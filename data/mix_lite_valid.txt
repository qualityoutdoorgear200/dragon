died Aug. 28, 1818, St. Charles, Mo., U.S.
black pioneer trader and founder of the settlement that later became the city of Chicago.
Du Sable, whose French father had moved to Haiti and married a black woman there, is believed to have been a freeborn. At some time in the 1770s he went to the Great Lakes area of North America, settling on the shore of Lake Michigan at the mouth of the Chicago River, with his Potawatomi wife, Kittihawa (Catherine). His loyalty to the French and the Americans led to his arrest in 1779 by the British, who took him to Fort Mackinac. From 1780 to 1783 or 1784 he managed for his captors a trading post called the Pinery on the St. Clair River in present-day Michigan, after which he returned to the site of Chicago. By 1790 Du Sable's establishment there had become an important link in the region's fur and grain trade.
In 1800 he sold out and moved to Missouri, where he continued as a farmer and trader until his death. But his 20-year residence on the shores of Lake Michigan had established his title as Father of Chicago.

# 3.1.1: Normal Form in Two Variables

Consider the differential equation

\label{eqnplane}\tag{3.1.1.1}
a(x,y)u_{xx}+2b(x,y)u_{xy}+c(x,y)u_{yy}+\mbox{terms of lower order}=0

in $$\Omega ubset\mathbb{R}^2$$. The associated characteristic differential equation is

\label{planechar}\tag{3.1.1.2}
a\chi_x^2+2b\chi_x\chi_y+c\chi_y^2=0.

We show that an appropriate coordinate transform will simplify equation (\ref{eqnplane}) sometimes in such a way that we can solve the transformed equation explicitly.

Let $$z=\phi(x,y)$$ be a solution of (\ref{planechar}). Consider the level sets $$\{(x,y):\ \phi(x,y)=const.\}$$ and assume  $$\phi_y\not=0$$ at a point $$(x_0,y_0)$$ of the level set. Then there is a function $$y(x)$$ defined in a neighborhood of $$x_0$$ such that $$\phi(x,y(x))=const.$$ It follows

$$y'(x)=-\dfrac{\phi_x}{\phi_y},$$

which implies, see the characteristic equation (\ref{planechar}),

ay'^2-2by'+c=0.

Then, provided  $$a\not=0$$, we can calculate $$\mu:=y'$$ from the (known) coefficients $$a$$, $$b$$ and $$c$$:

\label{mu}\tag{3.1.1.4}
\mu_{1,2}=\dfrac{1}{a}\left(b\pm qrt{b^2-ac}\right).

These solutions are real if and only of $$ac-b^2\le0$$.

Equation (\ref{eqnplane}) is hyperbolic if $$ac-b^2<0$$, parabolic if  $$ac-b^2=0$$ and ellipticif  $$ac-b^2>0$$. This follows from an easy discussion of the eigenvalues of the matrix

$$\left(\begin{array}{cc} a&b\\ b&c \end{array}\right),$$

see an exercise.

### Normal form of a hyperbolic equation

Let $$\phi$$ and $$\psi$$ are solutions of the characteristic equation (\ref{planechar}) such that

\begin{eqnarray*}
y_1'\equiv\mu_1&=&-\dfrac{\phi_x}{\phi_y}\\
y_2'\equiv\mu_2&=&-\dfrac{\psi_x}{\psi_y},
\end{eqnarray*}

where $$\mu_1$$ and $$\mu_2$$ are given by (\ref{mu}). Thus $$\phi$$ and $$\psi$$ are solutions of the linear homogeneous equations of first order

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{phi}\tag{3.1.1.5}
\phi_x+\mu_1(x,y)\phi_y&=&0\\
\label{psi}\tag{3.1.1.6}
\psi_x+\mu_2(x,y)\psi_y&=&0.
\end{eqnarray}

Assume $$\phi(x,y)$$, $$\psi(x,y)$$ are solutions such that $$\nabla\phi\not=0$$ and $$\nabla\psi\not=0$$, see an exercise for the existence of such solutions.

Consider two families of level sets defined by $$\phi(x,y)=\alpha$$ and $$\psi(x,y)=\beta$$, see Figure 3.1.1.1.

Figure 3.1.1.1: Level sets

These level sets are characteristic curves of the partial differential equations (\ref{phi}) and (\ref{psi}), respectively, see an exercise of the previous chapter.

Lemma. (i) Curves from different families can not touch each other

(ii) $$\phi_x\psi_y-\phi_y\psi_x\not=0$$.

Proof. (i):
$$y_2'-y_1'\equiv\mu_2-\mu_1=-\dfrac{2}{a} qrt{b^2-ac}\not=0.$$
(ii):
$$\mu_2-\mu_1=\dfrac{\phi_x}{\phi_y}-\dfrac{\psi_x}{\psi_y}.$$

$$\Box$$

Proposition 3.1. The mapping $$\xi=\phi(x,y)$$, $$\eta=\psi(x,y)$$ transforms equation (\ref{eqnplane}) into

\label{normhyp}\tag{3.1.1.7}
v_{\xi\eta}=\mbox{lower order terms},

where $$v(\xi,\eta)=u(x(\xi,\eta),y(\xi,\eta))$$.}

Proof. The proof follows from a straightforward calculation.
\begin{eqnarray*}
u_x&=&v_\xi\phi_x+v_\eta\psi_x\\
u_y&=&v_\xi\phi_y+v_\eta\psi_y\\
u_{xx}&=&v_{\xi\xi}\phi_x^2+2v_{\xi\eta}\phi_x\psi_x+v_{\eta\eta}\psi_x^2+\mbox{lower order terms}\\
u_{xy}&=&v_{\xi\xi}\phi_x\phi_y+v_{\xi\eta}(\phi_x\psi_y+\phi_y\psi_x)+v_{\eta\eta}\psi_x\psi_y+\mbox{lower order terms}\\
u_{yy}&=&v_{\xi\xi}\phi_y^2+2v_{\xi\eta}\phi_y\psi_y+v_{\eta\eta}\psi_y^2+\mbox{lower order terms}.
\end{eqnarray*}
Thus
$$au_{xx}+2bu_{xy}+cu_{yy}=\alpha v_{\xi\xi}+2\beta v_{\xi\eta}+\gamma v_{\eta\eta}+l.o.t.,$$
where
\begin{eqnarray*}
\alpha:&=&a\phi_x^2+2b\phi_x\phi_y+c\phi_y^2\\
\beta:&=&a\phi_x\psi_x+b(\phi_x\psi_y+\phi_y\psi_x)+c\phi_y\psi_y\\
\gamma:&=&a\psi_x^2+2b\psi_x\psi_y+c\psi_y^2.
\end{eqnarray*}
The coefficients $$\alpha$$ and $$\gamma$$ are zero since $$\phi$$ and $$\psi$$ are solutions of the characteristic equation. Since
$$\alpha\gamma-\beta^2=(ac-b^2)(\phi_x\psi_y-\phi_y\psi_x)^2,$$
it follows from the above lemma that the coefficient $$\beta$$ is different from zero.

$$\Box$$

Example 3.1.1.1:

Consider the differential equation
$$u_{xx}-u_{yy}=0.$$
The associated characteristic differential equation is
$$\chi_x^2-\chi_y^2=0.$$
Since $$\mu_1=-1$$ and $$\mu_2=1$$, the functions $$\phi$$ and $$\psi$$ satisfy differential equations
\begin{eqnarray*}
\phi_x+\phi_y&=&0\\
\psi_x-\psi_y&=&0.
\end{eqnarray*}
Solutions with $$\nabla\phi\not=0$$ and $$\nabla\psi\not=0$$ are
$$\phi=x-y,\ \ \psi=x+y.$$
Then the mapping
$$\xi=x-y,\ \ \eta=x+y$$
$$v_{\xi\eta} (\xi,\eta)=0.$$
Assume $$v\in C^2$$ is a solution, then $$v_\xi=f_1(\xi)$$ for an arbitrary $$C^1$$ function $$f_1(\xi)$$. It follows
$$v(\xi,\eta)=\int_0^\xi\ f_1(\alpha)\ d\alpha+g(\eta),$$
where $$g$$ is an arbitrary $$C^2$$ function. Thus each $$C^2$$-solution of the differential equation can be written as

$$( tar)$$  $$v(\xi,\eta)=f(\xi)+g(\eta)$$,

where $$f,\ g\in C^2$$. On the other hand, for arbitrary $$C^2$$-functions $$f$$, $$g$$ the function $$( tar)$$ is a solution of the differential equation $$v_{\xi\eta}=0$$. Consequently every $$C^2$$-solution of the original equation $$u_{xx}-u_{yy}=0$$ is given by
$$u(x,y)=f(x-y)+g(x+y),$$
where $$f,\ g\in C^2$$.

Michael Specter has an interesting article in The New Yorker about global warming and how "dazzlingly complex" it all is once you start to take all of the factors into account.
the calculations required to assess the full environmental impact of how we live can be dazzlingly complex. To sum them up on a label will not be easy. Should the carbon label on a jar of peanut butter include the emissions caused by the fertilizer, calcium, and potassium applied to the original crop of peanuts? What about the energy used to boil the peanuts once they have been harvested, or to mold the jar and print the labels? Seen this way, carbon costs multiply rapidly. A few months ago, scientists at the Stockholm Environment Institute reported that the carbon footprint of Christmas—including food, travel, lighting, and gifts—was six hundred and fifty kilograms per person. That is as much, they estimated, as the weight of “one thousand Christmas puddings” for every resident of England.
This passage caught my attention. We need to look at the whole picture and not just the impact of our individual actions. Remember all of the "save the rain forest" campaigns during the 1980's? My 7th grade science class wrote a letter to the Ecuadorian Embassy to encourage them to stop deforestation. It's great that carbon emissions are getting so much attention, but they're just a piece of the overall puzzle.
Just two countries—Indonesia and Brazil—account for about ten per cent of the greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. Neither possesses the type of heavy industry that can be found in the West, or for that matter in Russia or India. Still, only the United States and China are responsible for greater levels of emissions. That is because tropical forests in Indonesia and Brazil are disappearing with incredible speed. “It’s really very simple,” John O. Niles told me. Niles, the chief science and policy officer for the environmental group Carbon Conservation, argues that spending five billion dollars a year to prevent deforestation in countries like Indonesia would be one of the best investments the world could ever make. “The value of that land is seen as consisting only of the value of its lumber,” he said. “A logging company comes along and offers to strip the forest to make some trivial wooden product, or a palm-oil plantation. The governments in these places have no cash. They are sitting on this resource that is doing nothing for their economy. So when a guy says, ‘I will give you a few hundred dollars if you let me cut down these trees,’ it’s not easy to turn your nose up at that. Those are dollars people can spend on schools and hospitals.”
The ecological impact of decisions like that are devastating. Decaying trees contribute greatly to increases in the levels of greenhouse gases. Plant life absorbs CO2. But when forests disappear, the earth loses one of its two essential carbon sponges (the other is the ocean). The results are visible even from space. Satellite photographs taken over Indonesia and Brazil show thick plumes of smoke rising from the forest. According to the latest figures, deforestation pushes nearly six billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere every year. That amounts to thirty million acres—an area half the size of the United Kingdom—chopped down each year. Put another way, according to one recent calculation, during the next twenty-four hours the effect of losing forests in Brazil and Indonesia will be the same as if eight million people boarded airplanes at Heathrow Airport and flew en masse to New York.

Help with Xray Scattering: Reconciling Bragg Scattering with Fraunhofer Diffraction

Summary:

Most (if not all) XRay scattering discussions center around Bragg's Law of reflection. However, most experiments seem to be better described by Fraunhofer diffraction. Is there a way of connecting these phenomena? Or could someone with more Xray experience help me reconcile these approaches?

Main Question or Discussion Point

1. Quick derivation of bragg scattering
2. Discussion of modern xray experiments as they relate to bragg/fraunhofer
3. Summary of points.

Bragg/von Lau Scattering:
(I will be following Ashcroft if you want to sing along, pg 98-99)
Imagine you have light incident on some crystal structure with wavevector ##k=2π\hat{n}/λ##. You make the following assumption-- the light is scattered elastically (its wavelength doesn't change). For constructive interference, the path difference between any two scattered rays must be an integer number of wavelengths, which gives the von Lau condition:
$$R \cdot{} (k-k') = 2 \pi m$$
with R being a lattice vector, k being the incident, and k' being the outcident. This is equivalent to saying that the difference between the incident and outcident vectors must be a reciprocal lattice vector (2πmR).

Because the scattering is elastic |k|=|k′|, and we can use this to derive the following:
$$\vec{k} \cdot{} \hat{K} = \frac{1}{2} K$$
(Graphically, you can see this in the following geometric construction: you have two vectors of the same length. Subtracting them gives a third vector. Because the two original vectors are the same length, this makes an isosceles triangle. You can verify that each of the two equal lines in an isoceles triangle, when projected onto the third line, each compose 1/2 of the third line. See Ashcroft pg 99 for a picture of this (or my badly drawn Figure 1.)

Problem
Imagine you have a beam of light incident on a 1D lattice (see Figure 2), where the scattering vector is incident along ##\hat{x}## and the crystal bravais lattice is along ##\hat{z}.## In this geometry k⋅K=0, so bragg's law predicts that no scattering will occur (as far as I can see, see Figure 3). The issue then is that this is the geometry that is used for a lot of xray experiments! This is the geometry for instance of a syncrotron, where a beam of light is incident on a sample, and the detector measures transmission. If you look at a lot of Xray literature, the plots will often be in terms of the bragg angle ( 2θ).

To sum up, most theoretical descriptions of xray scattering use Bragg scattering (all the ones I've seen), when it appears that Bragg scattering gives nonsensical results in a very common experimental geometry. I can think of two solutions.

1. I'm an idiot and completely misunderstood Bragg scattering, or modern Xray science (in which case, could you point me in the direction of some resources that tackle this issue??!)
2. It doesn't matter/is an experimental approximation. Most crystal lattices are on the order of 10's of angstroms, so you'd only need a deviation from a pure ## \hat{x}## incident by arctan(.5∗K/k) to meet the bragg condition, which would be small.

Lattice reduction in R^3 (R^4) or what is fundamental domain for SL(3,Z) , (SL(4,Z)) ?

Consider a lattice in R^3. Is the some "canonical" way or ways to choose basis in it ?

I mean in R^2 we can choose a basis |h_1| < |h_2| and |(h_2, h_1)| < 1/2 |h_1|. Considering lattices with fixed determinant and up to unitary transformations we get standard picture of the PSL(2,Z) acting on the upper half plane, which has a fundamental domain Im (tau)>1 Re(tau) <1/2.

What are the similar results for other small dimensions R^3, R^4, C^4, C^8 ? What are the algorithms to find such a lattice reductions ?

-

I actually meant the Gram matrix for a basis of the lattice, so it is both positive definite and symmetric. A change of basis matrix $U \in \textup{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ acts on a Gram matrix $M$ by sending it to $UMU^t$. There are a couple of advantages of using these coordinates. One is that passing to the Gram matrix automatically mods out by the orthogonal group, and the other is that some constraints that are nonlinear in terms of a basis matrix become linear in terms of a Gram matrix. (For example, vector lengths in the lattice are linear functions of the Gram matrix entries.) –  Henry Cohn Apr 17 '11 at 12:46

Should I delete and repost in another community?
I asked https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/23074/can-i-add-tmc-stepsticks-in-parallel-with-existing-a4988 but it seems this community lacks the electronics knowledge to answer it.
Would it be fine to delete and repost in the community Electronics? or somehow to move the question there?
Or should I ask there as well with a link? this solution doesn't look tidy to me.
-> final choice: new question https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/702418/can-i-add-tmc-stepsticks-in-parallel-with-existing-a4988

No, you can't cross-post. The easiest option is to delete it here and then repost elsewhere. Migration requires an agreement and negotiation. Delete the question here, ask on SE.Electric and if you have no luck then you can always delete that question and undelete the question on here. Does that make sense? I've only just seen your question. Looks interesting. (You could always offer a bounty on the question on this site, or you could promote a link to your question on a blog or external site(s), to increase visibility)

Hmmm, there is certainly more to your question than initially meets the eye (re. current draw and the unloaded drivers). I would  not be prepared to post a qualified answer, without being able to try it out first (which I am currently unable to do). Maybe it is better to post on SE.Electronics after all..? Now, I would like to know the answer too :-) (You could post a similar question on SE.Electronics, and so long as it is different enough (ask about a different aspect, or from a different angle), then maybe you could keep both in place - but this seems to be stretching the rules a bit)

I'm deleting it, if I ask a different question than I may not get the answer I need

Ok, fair enough. Good luck. Maybe post the link to the new question here?

Interestingly, an apparently similar question has been asked, Using dual Y stepper drivers on Marlin / RAMPS 1.4. At least, at first glance, it seems similar.

The thread creation ratio is a pair of two underlying metrics. The (1) ratio between the number of threads and the total posts and (2) the ratio between initiated threads and total threads in the network.

Smith et al. (2009) call these two metrics Verbosity and Initation, while Angeletou et al. (2011) are writing about Thread Initation Ratios. These metrics were later picked up by Hacker et al. (2015) and Viol et al. (2016). They are of ego-centric scope as they can be calculated for individuals, although the calculation of an average over the whole network is feasible.

The calculation of the single thread creation ratio $st$ and the total thread creation ratio $tt$ is straightforward and can be accomplished in one step each:

(1): st := select count of threads / count of posts
(2): tt := select count of initiated threads / count of all threads


Viol et al. (2016) and Hacker et al. (2015) conclude that a high number of threads compared to the number of posts, is a sign of information sharing. A user with many threads is informing other users about events or other news. However, Hacker mentions that their analysis result does not support this notion for threads, which do not receive any replies. These may be unanswered questions or uninteresting posts.

Another notion presented by Viol et al. (2016) is that a high value indicates users who share knowledge and ideas with others, spawning new discussions threads. These discussion threads contribute content and ideas to the network. This fits with the first interpretation that replies are needed in the threads.

Hansen et al. (2010) describe such users as discussion starters and Rowe et al. (2013) as expert participants, while Angeletou et al. (2011) speak of popular initators. Due to their creation of threads, they are usually well known in the network and have high visibility. Users with a low ratio only post occasionally and are unlikely to start their own topics. Smith et al. (2009) claim that more threads are better for the network as it indicates the generation of new ideas and discussions.

Social relationships are only formed, when other users respond to a thread. Therefore this metric alone is not sufficient to make any claims about Social Capital. However, if a particular thread gathers attention, this indicates a high level of engagement in discussions and the exchange of new ideas. This facilitates Bonding Social Capital as people exchange their thoughts and ideas to form a shared understanding.

The Unavoidable Instability of Brand Image

June 4, 2014
By

(This article was first published on Engaging Market Research, and kindly contributed to R-bloggers)

"It may be that most consumers forget the attribute-based reasons why they chose or rejected the many brands they have considered and instead retain just a summary attitude sufficient to guide choice the next time."
This is how Dolnicar and Rossiter conclude their paper on the low stability of brand-attribute associations. Evidently, we need to be very careful how we ask the brand image question in order to get test-retest agreement over 50%. "Is the Fiat 500 a practical car?" Across all consumers, those that checked "Yes" at time one will have only a 50-50 chance of checking "Yes" again at time two, even when the time interval is only a few weeks. Perhaps, brand-attribute association is not something worth remembering since consumers do not seem to remember all that well.

In the marketplace a brand attitude, such as an overall positive or negative affective response, would be all that a consumer would need in order to know whether to approach or avoid any particular brand when making a purchase decision. If, in addition, a consumer had some way of anticipating how well the brand would perform, then the brand image question could be answered without retrieving any specific factual memories of the brand-attribute association. By returning the consumer to the purchase context, the focus is placed back on the task at hand and what needs to be accomplished. The consumer retrieves from memory what is required to make a purchase. Affect determines orientation, and brand recognition provides performance expectations. Buying does not demand a memory dump. Recall is selective. More importantly, recall is constructive.

For instance, unless I have tried to sell or buy a pre-owned car, I might not know whether a particular automobile has a high resale value. In fact, if you asked me for a dollar value, that number would depend on whether I was buying or selling. The buyer is surprised (as in sticker shock) by how expensive used cars can be, and the seller is disappointed by how little they can get for their prized possession. In such circumstances, when asked if I associate "high resale value" with some car, I cannot answer the factual question because I have no personal knowledge. So I answer a different, but easier, question instead. "Do I believe that the car has high resale value?" Respondents look inward and ask themselves, introspectively, "When I say 'The car has high resale value,' do I believe it to be true?" The box is checked if the answer is "Yes" or a rating is given indicating the strength of my conviction (feelings-as-information theory). Thus, perception is reality because factual knowledge is limited and unavailable.

How might this look in R?

A concrete example might be helpful. The R package plfm includes a data set with 78 respondents who were asked whether or not they associated each of 27 attributes with each of 14 European car models. That is, each respondent filled in the cells of a 14 x 27 table with the rows as cars and the columns as attributes. All the entries are zero or one identifying whether the respondent did (1) or did not (0) believe that the car model could be described with the attribute. By simply summing across the 78 different tables, we produce the aggregate cross-tabulation showing the number of respondents from 0 to 78 associating each attribute with each car model. A correspondence analysis provides a graphic display of such a matrix (see the appendix for all the R code).

Well, this ought to look familiar to anyone working in the automotive industry. Let's work our way around the four quadrants: Quadrant I Sporty, Quadrant II Economical, Quadrant III Family, and Quadrant IV Luxury. Another perspective is to see an economy-luxury dimension running from the upper left to the lower right and a family-sporty dimension moving from the lower left to the upper right (i.e., drawing a large X through the graph).

I have named these quadrants based only on the relative positions of the attributes by interpreting only the distances between the attributes. Now, I will examine the locations of the car models and rely only the distances between the cars. It appears that the economy cars, including the partially hidden Fiat 500, fall into Quadrant II where the Economical attributes also appear. The family cars are in Quadrant III, which is where the Family attributes are located. Where would you be if you were the BMW X5? Respondents would be likely to associate with you the same attributes as the Audi A4 and the Mercedes C-class, so you would find yourself in the cluster formed by these three car models.

Why am I talking in this way? Why don't I just say that the BMW X5 is seen as Powerful and therefore placed near its descriptor? I have presented the joint plot from correspondence analysis, which means that we interpret the inter-attribute distances and the inter-car distances but not the car-attribute distances. It is a long story with many details concerning how distances are scaled (chi-square distances), how the data matrix is decomposed (singular value decomposition), and how the coordinates are calculated. None of this is the focus of this post, but it is so easy to misinterpret a perceptual map that some warning must be issued. A reference providing more detail might be helpful (see Figure 5c).

Using the R code at the end of this post, you will be able to print out the crosstab. Given the space limitation, the attribute profiles for only a few representative car models have been listed below. To make it easier, I have ordered the columns so that the ordering follows the quadrants: the Mazda MX5 is sporty, the Fiat 500 is city focus, the Renault Espace is family oriented, and the BMW X5 is luxurious. When interpreting these frequencies, one needs to remember that it is the relative profile that is being plotted on the correspondence map. That is, two cars with the same pattern of high and low attribute associations would appear near each other even if one received consistently higher mentions. You should check for yourself, but the map seems to capture the relationships between the attributes and the cars in the data table (with the exception of Prius to be discussed next).

 Mazda MX5 Fiat 500 Renault Espace BMW X5 VW Golf Toyota Prius Sporty 65 8 1 47 29 8 Nice design 40 35 17 31 20 9 Attractive 39 40 12 36 33 10 City focus 9 58 5 1 30 26 Agile 22 53 9 15 40 10 Economical 3 49 17 1 29 42 Original 22 37 7 8 5 19 Family Oriented 1 3 74 41 12 39 Practical 6 39 52 23 44 16 Comfortable 12 6 47 46 27 23 Versatile 5 5 39 30 25 21 Luxurious 28 6 10 58 12 11 Powerful 37 1 9 57 20 9 Status symbol 39 12 6 51 23 16 Outdoor 13 1 20 46 6 4 Safe 4 5 23 40 40 19 Workmanship 13 3 4 28 14 19 Exclusive 17 14 3 19 0 8 Reliable 17 11 17 38 58 27 Popular 5 24 27 13 55 10 Sustainable 8 7 18 19 43 29 High trade-in value 4 3 0 36 41 4 Good price-quality ratio 11 20 15 7 30 21 Value for the money 9 7 12 8 24 10 Environmentally friendly 6 32 7 2 20 51 Technically advanced 17 2 6 32 10 46 Green 0 10 2 2 6 36

Now, what about Prius? I have included in the appendix the R code to extract a third dimension and generate a plot showing how this third dimension separates the attributes and the cars. If you run this code, you will discover that the third dimension separates Prius from the other cars. In addition, Green and Environmentally Friendly can be found nearby, along with "Technically Advanced." You can visualize this third dimension by seeing Prius as coming out of the two-dimensional map along with the two attributes. This allows us to maintain the two-dimensional map with Prius "tagged" as not as close to VW Golf as shown (e.g., shadowing the Prius label might add the desired 3D effect).

The Perceptual Map Varies with Objects and Features

What would have happened had Prius not be included in association task? Would the Fiat 500 been seen as more environmentally friendly? The logical response is to be careful about what cars to include in the competitive set. However, the competitive set is seldom the same for all car buyers. For example, two consumers are considering the same minivan, but one is undecided between the minivan and a family sedan and the other is debating between the minivan and a SUV. Does anyone believe that the comparison vehicle, the family sedan or the SUV, will not impact the minivan perceptions? The brand image that I create in order complete a survey is not the brand image that I construct in order to make a purchase. The correspondence map is a spatial representation of this one particular data matrix obtained by recruiting and surveying consumers. It is not the brand image.

As I have outlined in previous work, brand image is not simply a network of association evoked by a name, a package, or a logo. Branding is a way of seeing, or as Douglas Holt describes it, "a perceptual frame structuring product experience." I used the term "affordance" in my earlier post to communicate that brand benefits are perceived directly and immediately as an experience. Thus, brand image is not a completed project, stored always in memory, and waiting to be retrieved to fill in our brand-attribute association matrix. Like preference, brand image is constructed anew to complete the task at hand. The perceptual frame provides the scaffolding, but the specific requirements of each task will have unique impacts and instability is unavoidable.

Even if we attempt to keep everything the same at two points in time, the brand image construction process will amplify minor fluctuations and make it difficult for an individual to reproduce the same set of responses each time. However, none of this may impact the correspondence map for we are mapping aggregate data, which can be relatively stable even with considerable random individual variation. Yet, such instability at the individual level must be disturbing for the marketer who believes that brand image is established and lasting rather than a construction adapting to the needs of the purchase context.

The initial impulse is to save brand image by adding constraints to the measurement task in order to increase stability. But this misses the point. There is no true brand image to be measured. We would be better served by trying to design measurement tasks that mimic how brand image is constructed under the conditions of the specific purchase task we wish to study. The brand image that is erected when forming a consideration set is not the brand image that is assembled when making the final purchase decision.

Florida Geological Survey Fossil Collection in the Florida Museum of Natural History
The Florida Geological Survey fossil vertebrate collection (FGS) was started during the 1910s and was originally housed in Tallahassee. Under the direction of E. H. Sellards, Herman Gunter, and S. J. Olsen, the FGS collection was the primary source of fossil vertebrate descriptions from Florida until the early 1960s. World-renown paleontologists such as George G. Simpson, Edwin H. Colbert, and Henry F. Osborn wrote scientific papers about specimens in the FGS collection in addition to Sellards and Olsen. In 1976 the entire FGS fossil vertebrate collection was transferred to the Florida Museum of Natural History with support from a National Science Foundation grant. The UF/FGS collection is composed of about 22,000 specimens assigned to about 10,000 catalogue numbers, and almost all of them were collected in Florida. The majority of specimens in the UF/FGS collection are mammals, followed by reptiles, birds, and a relatively small number of amphibians and fish. Although there are some sites that are unique to the UF/FGS collection, many of the sites overlap with holdings in the main UF and UF/PB collections. The major strengths of the UF/FGS collection are historically important samples from the early Miocene Thomas Farm locality, the middle Miocene and early Pliocene deposits of the Bone Valley Region, Polk County, and from the late Pleistocene Vero locality, Indian River County. Researchers using the UF/FGS database should be aware that when the catalogue data for the FGS collection was first transferred from the original file cards to a computerized database in the late 1980s, relatively little effort was made to correct or improve entries. The nature of specimen was not indicated on many of the cards, locality information was sometimes vague, and many employed taxonomic names that are no longer in use. While some corrections have subsequently been made to this database, limitations of time and resources have prevented an exhaustive clean-up. Also, when Sellards left Florida for Texas in the 1920s, he transferred some, but not all, of the holotypes in the FGS collection that he had named to the USNM collection, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.

"slicer" tag: unneeded duplicate or unclear meaning?
I was checking tags and I saw that "slicer" has only 6 questions, and no clear use case since there is already "slicing".
There are some options now:

reclassify those 6 questions into "slicing" and then set the two tags as synonyms
clarify the purpose of each tag which likely includes renaming them, because right now picking the correct one may not be obvious to most users. This may involve a general (re)classification into each tag of questions which were mistagged or not tagged with either one


Yeah, sounds like it could be a good idea. However, is there really no difference between slicer and slicing? I can't think of any differences, off the top of my head - unless the former is about the software and the latter is the process. I see that slicer has no tag info, defining how the tag is meant to be used, whereas slicing does have a clear tag usage. More importantly, leading on from that, are the tagged questions themselves tagged "correctly"?

Do the questions in the two tag groups have different leanings, i.e. those tagged slicing are more process oriented and those tagged slicer are more software oriented?

@Greenonline yes, "slicing" could be referred to the math/process of slicing and "slicer" to software related questions. But then it should be written and there's a lot of tagging to be done to make it meaningful

+1 - For bringing this question up

@Greenonline it would be good for Stachexchange to provide tools for mass-tagging. Obviously to be used by very high-ranking members (or specifically nominated members) to avoid troubles, but it would help a lot

You would need to raise a question of the main meta site for that. However, as the analysis shows, mass tagging fortunately (hopefully) will not be required in this case

FWIW, I have retagged the four questions that where incorrectly tagged as "slicer" by their OP's. So that leaves just two questions.

@Greenonline I'm not sure how I should proceed now, or whether I should do anything to begin with. I'm not a mod/admin/anyone relevant, so I think my task ends here with this questions and my answer with the proposal.

I have removed the offending tag by retagging questions to slicing.
Problem solved
:-)

If you, or anyone else, wishes to go through all of the questions and perform the "slicer-software" and "slicing-theory" procedure, then you are more than welcome. You don't need to be a mod or admin, or whatever to do that.
Anyone with sufficient reputation can create tags, create tag descriptions, synonyms and perform retagging.
See Privileges for more information:

150 -> create tags
1250 -> tag synonyms
1500 -> approve tag edits


this also avoids the confusion of [tag:slic3r] with any other slicer.

This isn't an answer, but rather an appraisal of the situation and analysis 

From earlier comments

Yeah, sounds like it could be a good idea. However, is there really no difference between slicer and slicing? I can't think of any differences, off the top of my head - unless the former is about the software and the latter is the process. I see that slicer has no tag info, defining how the tag is meant to be used, whereas slicing does have a clear tag usage.
More importantly, leading on from that, are the tagged questions themselves tagged "correctly"?
Do the questions in the two tag groups have different leanings, i.e. those tagged slicing are more process oriented and those tagged slicer are more software oriented?


At first look
As stated in the question, there are currently 204 slicing questions and 6 slicer questions.
The missing tag info for slicer is easy to add - anyone can do so. I don't know why it wasn't added when the tag was added (more about this below, see Further Analysis).
Whilst having two tags seems to make sense, the questions should be checked to see that they have been tagged correctly (i.e. software or process oriented). This isn't an insurmountable task, although 204 is a bit of a chore. It's been done before, see the maker and model meta question, Tag Maintenance Summer 2019.
However, if while checking whether the questions have been tagged correctly,  it then becomes a bit of a headache actually distinguishing the questions correctly - that is to say, determining whether slicing or slicer (or even both!) applies - then maybe, one should be the synonym of the other.
Further analysis
Looking at the dates of the two groups of questions, it seems that slicer is actually a (relatively) recent tag, presumably introduced in May 2021 with this question, How to fix zits and blobs caused by Cura? , which seems to be reasonable as the question is about Cura, rather than slicing, in general. However, I might be wrong in thinking this, I don't know - maybe slicing would have still be sufficient tag for this question, in which case, the whole slicer issue started with this question.
However, further checking reveals that slicer was only added to that question, a month ago by this edit. So, really, this question could be retagged to slicing without issue, as it has only had the (alleged) "wrong" tag for a few weeks.
That leaves 5 remaining slicer questions, and then the next oldest question tagged slicer is Are there any slicers that use anti-aliasing (such as FXAA) for higher quality thumbnail generation?, which is where and when the slicer tag was introduced - 30 Nov 2023 - so it really is a late addition. Interestingly, the same user edited the previous, older question to add the slicer.
Again, this question could be considered to be about slicers rather than slicing, but whether that merits having a new tag, that could potentially cause endless confusion, and mis-tagging, down the line.
 The other four remaining questions were tagged as slicer by their respective OPs, and while at least two of them (Does FreeCAD produce a wrong stl for slicer software? and Effect of top thickness on print with bumps on top) could be considered correctly tagged as slicer, IMHO moving them to slicing wouldn't harm the questions. The other two (Encountering some weird layer gaps on the last few lines of a particular print and Deformed 45 deg angle on outer wall) look to have been incorrectly tagged, and slicing would be more appropriate.
Update: I have retagged these last four questions as slicing
Was there a need for a new "slicer" tag?
I would like to ask the OP, who introduced the slicer tag, their reasoning for doing so, as well as:

Why no tag info was added for slicer, in order to distinguish its use from that of slicing?
Was the existing slicing deemed not to be appropriate, if so, why not?

I would suggest that we wait for an answer/response to those questions, before we even consider blatting the slicer tag (or creating a synonym).
There may be a legitimate reason to have a distinct tag, especially if there is a need and desire to separate software from process.
Moving forward
It may be decided by the community that a distinction is required and hence the need for two tags.
However, if it is determined that there isn't a real need for a new tag, then we have two options:

Create a synonym
Just re-tag the slicer questions to slicing

This latter option seems the easiest option and just returns everything to the way that they were prior to slicer having been introduced.

Very nice analysis! I'm in favor to retag, and update the slicing tag to include process and software questions should be tagged with this tag.

Thanks. Yes, I definitely agree. However, the devil's advocate in me says that having one tag for both process and software is great... for a small amount of questions. However, as the number of questions grows, and the two groups of questions grow in size, will it become more and more difficult for someone to find a "slicer" software-based question, when they aren't interested in the process (i.e. the "slicing" tagged questions)? Does that make sense? However, I must admit that I struggle to think of why such a scenario would exist.

The questions about the slicing theory and process may be retagged with a clearly defined tag, like "slicing-theory". People will type "slic" in the tag field and see both "slicer" and "slicing-theory" and hopefully get what they mean, not to mention the summary also provided. "slicer" could also be renamed (is it possible?) to something more clearly directed to the software usage

@FarO - Yes, renaming is possible. Whilst I was playing devil's-advocate in my comment above, I did have a secondary thought overnight that maybe even with two well labelled tags, we could still end up with a new user typing slic and then wondering which tag to choose, and potential mis-tagging occurring. So, I have now (for the moment)  come back over to the side of just one tag - just for ease of administration. Just my thoughts, this morning.

However, it should be said that the proposal of having two tags has now changed the nature of your original question somewhat. We've gone from synonym, through removing this new slicer tag, and now back to having two tags. The more options that there are, then the more complication finding a resolution becomes. The correct way, would be to hammer out in this question what the options are, and then, once they have been decided, then a new voting meta question should really be posted so that a clear voting structure is achieved.

This does seem overly complicated, when we could just revert back to the way everything was pre-Nov 2023

I updated the question to reflect the options.

Just updated my new answer from yesterday. I got cut short in my writing as I had to go do something else.

Right now the tags "slicer" and "slicing" may have different meaning, but likely most people using the site won't notice it.
We could

delete "slicer" and retag the 6 questions into "slicing" but we should also add a description for it,
rename them into "slicer-software" and "slicing-theory" to make obvious to most people whether we are talking about usage or the math/theory behind.

Since the theory behind slicing should be covered by a tag (there are questions about it from time to time) and I see none, "slicing-theory" could be the one. Of course some (re)tagging to make use of the new tag is needed.
I am in favour of the latter.

Yes, the latter option (which is more elegant and "future-proof") would require us going through 204 questions re-tagging as appropriate. The former option is much easier to implement. By future-proof I mean that in ten years time, when there are 1000 questions, it will be easier to find a theory question or  a software question if we have two tags. The question is, do we want to go through some pain now to have this "nice future"... or do we just put the issue off and have a similar situation to Y2k or UNIX 2038 bugs, and just let someone else deal with it, later..? Over-dramatic? Maybe.

Nice answer, btw. However, it might be a good idea to split your two options into two answers - otherwise what does an upvote on your single answer mean?

204 questions plus potentially many more not tagged as slic* at all, but a quick search could find them easily

@Greenonline I thought this is about discussion only, and another question will be opened about the actual voting

Yes, good point. We can still do that, but I thought maybe posting two answers, might mean we don't need to post another meta vote question. However, my long and windy non-answer probably makes it difficult/confusing to turn this into a voting question - so yeah, a separate voting meta question is probably the best way to go. Also, good point about some questions that may not be tagged at all.

# [webkit-dev] Proposal: remove menclose notation radical

Frédéric WANG fred.wang at free.fr
Thu Mar 10 03:45:04 PST 2016

Hi everyone,

As said in a previous message, MathML layout refactoring is in progress
[1] and I'd like to use this opportunity to propose removing support for

More context:

In MathML3 there are three ways to write roots:

1) <msqrt> child1 child2 ... child3 </msqrt>, equivalent to the LaTeX
expression  qrt{child1 child2 ... child3} i.e. square root of "child1
child2 ... child3".
2) <mroot> child1 child2 </mroot>, equivalent to the LaTeX expression
 qrt[child2]{child1} i.e. "child2"-th root of "child1".
3) <menclose notation="radical"> child1 child2 ... child3 </menclose>,
equivalent to 1)

Currently 1) and 2) share an implementation in the RenderMathMLRoot
class. That implementation relies on anonymous renderers and flexbox
layout and has many issues with dynamic changes of child list, style,
zoom etc. However, I've uploaded a patch to do a complete refactoring of
RenderMathMLRoot in bug 153987 [2] which solves these issues.

The menclose element definitely needs a clean rewriting too. In
particular, 3) is implemented by appending an anonymous RenderMathMLRoot
child in which we put all the other children ; and again dynamic changes
are not handled very well . I have uploaded a patch to bug 155019 [3] in
order to completely rewrite the menclose implementation and I decided to
reuse RenderMathMLRoot.

I expect this removal to be safe for the users given that (except in
examples and tests) I've always seen 1) preferred over 3) in math
documents. The only rationale for 3) would be to write overlapping
notations (e.g. <menclose notation="radical circle horizontalstrike">)
but again I'm not aware of any concrete use case for that and it's
always possible to nest <msqrt> and <menclose> to get similar rendering.
Finally, note that the accessibility code does expose the radical
notation and my patch for bug 155019 does not affect that code.

I plan to ask the same to Mozilla developers (FYI in Gecko, 1) and 3)
are implemented in the same class but 2) is implemented in a separate
class with duplicate code ; so it would also make sense for them to do a
simplification). In the future, I also plan to ask to the Math WG to
deprecate this notation and this is already done in the current draft of
the MathML in HTML5 implementation note I wrote [4]. Anyway, the MathML
"Conforming renderers may ignore any value they do not handle, although
renderers are encouraged to render as many of the values listed below as
possible" [5].

What is Morbid Obesity?
Obesity becomes "morbid" when it reaches the point of significantly increasing the risk of one or more obesity-related health conditions or serious diseases (also known as co-morbidities) that result either in significant physical disability or even death. As you read about morbid obesity you may also see the term "clinically severe obesity" used. Both are descriptions of the same condition and can be used interchangeably. Morbid obesity is typically defined as being 100 lbs. or more over ideal body weight or having a Body Mass Index of 40 or higher. According to the National Institutes of Health Consensus Report, morbid obesity is a serious disease and must be treated as such. It is a chronic disease, meaning that its symptoms build slowly over an extended period of time.

Anet A8 Calibrated but print sizes are wrong
Anet A8 printer, Github Marlin, Repetier Host, Cura slicer
Just setting up printer and printed 20mm calibration cube from Thingiverse. X,Y,Z & E not too far off but not quite right (centre hole was oval not round) X19.5mm, Y19.5mm & Z20mm.
Followed Youtube calibration help and updated firmware to Marlin. I ran several iterations of request travel, measure result and tweek stepper settings (M501,M92xxxx, M500) Live Die Repeat...
When I now print the calibration cube I get X25mm, Y20mm & Z19.5mm.
Could the issue be with the firmare being upgraded to Marlin? The cube was sliced by Cura and I have used the same file for all of the prints. When I stop the print and ask Repetier to move the steppers the distance is as they should be for a 100mm travel.

If you have a stock printer, your calibration values should be stock - i.e. 100 steps/mm for X/Y. Also, as an extra hint, X and Y steps should be identical since the mechanics are identical (unless you swapped out one of the motors or drive gears).
It sounds like you have Y correct, but something wrong with X. This could be the belt being damaged, or slipping (or having slipped during your initial cal, and not later). Try increasing/decreasing print speed, this might show up some dynamic problems with the movement.
If you print something bigger (like this) you don't need to worry so much about measurement precision and under/over-extrusion (which adds to the error, but doesn't scale with size).
You don't make it clear if you've started by calibrating your extruder. This is the most important first step, and ensures that you extrude the right length of filament during the print. All this requires is that you mark out 10cm of filament and extrude it into free space.

It was the different answers from printer and configuration.h that I was questioning. Sorry if I was not clear. All the other variables I can tweak/deal with, but not knowing which settings are in charge it is hard to see what to change.

In that case, I don't understand your question.

Bear with me. I noted the values of XYZE in the fi

Sorry, tinterweb dropped off twice. The question is why the steps/mm in configuration.h are not the same as the printer reports.

Eeprom values, I assume.

Does Marlin not load the "sketch/values" into the eeprom? Have I missed a step when I compiled the file and uploaded t? Should I have sent M500 to save the settings? I am working on the basis that I am learning this stuff from scratch and quite possibly making a hash of it.

We're way off track from what your question looks like. No, the firmware can't know that it's at 'first run' state. M502 might be what you are missing. M503 shows the current active settings (regardless of how they were obtained).

Thanks Sean, May have my M numbers mixed up, typing at work, crib sheet at home. What does "first run" mean?

How should the firmware know it's default values take precedence over the eprom value? M502 followed by M500 is reset and store in eeprom.

There could be a number of issues causing this.
Since you just set it up here is a list of questions for you to go through:

Are your belts tightened? (With an additional belt tightener)
Are your carriages are sliding smoothly?

Both might cause some irregular movements explaining the results being off.
Having said that, I wouldn't worry too much if you're <0.5 mm off. This is still a cheap DIY printer (I have the same one, by the way).
This video actually goes into some details why you shouldn't worry so much about 100% accuracy and what you should actually care for when tuning your printer: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Mbn1ckR86Z8
Also Not sure how you measured the cube but callipers are often also not that reliable.

"callipers are often also not that reliable".  Quotation needed.  All tools come rated for an error margin, calipers are typically accurate to 0.05mm.

That's true but with 3d printed objects your walls can be inconsistent so depending on where you measure or how hard you pressed when measuring can affect the readings.

measurement error is not the same than instrument accuracy though.  Calipers are accurate, but as any instrument, the operator needs to know how to use them! :)

Ah good point

All good points however it doesn't explain why uploaded configuring

Polish second most spoken language
Polish is the second most common main language in England and Wales with more than half a million speakers, according to new figures from the 2011 Census.
Nearly one in 10 people in England and Wales - 8% - reported speaking a different main language to English or Welsh in the census, findings from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) have shown.
Polish was the second most commonly reported main language with 546,000 speakers, reflecting more than half a million Poles who migrated to England and Wales during the last decade.
Redcar and Cleveland local authority had the highest percentage of people with English as their main language at 99% of the population, with Ealing listing the highest proportion of Polish speakers at 6% of the population.
In all but three of the London boroughs - the City of London, Richmond Upon Thames, and Hillingdon - more than 100 languages were listed as main languages.
Of the four million residents of England and Wales who spoke a main language other than English, 1.7 million said they could speak English very well, 726,000 could speak English but not well and 138,000 could not speak English at all.
The least common main language in England and Wales was listed as Manx-Gaelic with 33 speakers, followed by 58 Gaelic Scottish speakers.
London had the highest proportion, at 22%, of people who reported that English was not their main language, with the North East reporting the lowest percentage in this category, at 3%. The figures also showed that not all languages were spoken - with 22,000 people using sign language.
The census also appeared to confirm a boom in cycling in London, with 161,700 people, or 2.6%, using bicycles to get to work in the capital. This compared with 77,000 a decade ago, the ONS said, but these figures were not strictly comparable as the 2001 figures did not include those who said they worked from home.
Cambridge remained the local authority with the highest proportion who cycle to work, at 18%, or 17,755 people. In spite of the surge in cycling, the majority of 16 to 74-year-olds in England and Wales said they drove a car or van to work, at 58% or 15 million.

Healthy Eating Plate
Harvard’s New Guide to Healthy Eating
Start here to learn more about the new Healthy Eating Plate created by nutrition experts at Harvard School of Public Health, in conjunction with Harvard Health Publications. The Healthy Eating Plate can be your blueprint for planning a healthy balanced meal, and it fixes key flaws in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s MyPlate.
How can you follow the Healthy Eating Plate? Here’s a rundown, section by section:
- Fill half of your plate with vegetables and fruits. The more color, and the more variety on this part of the plate, the better. Potatoes and French fries don’t count as vegetables on the Healthy Eating Plate, because they are high in fast-digested starch (carbohydrate), which has the same roller-coaster effect on blood sugar and insulin as white bread and sweets. These surges, in the short term, can lead to hunger and overeating, and in the long term, can lead to weight gain, type 2 diabetes, and other health problems. Read more about vegetables and fruits, or read more about carbohydrates and health.
- Save a quarter of your plate for whole grains—not just any grains: Whole grains—whole wheat, brown rice, and foods made with them, such as whole wheat pasta—have a gentler effect on blood sugar and insulin than white bread, white rice, and other so-called “refined grains.” That’s why the Healthy Eating Plate says to choose whole grains—the less processed, the better—and limit refined grains. Read more about whole grains.
- Put a healthy source of protein on one quarter of your plate: Chose fish, chicken, beans or nuts, since these contain beneficial nutrients, such as the heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids in fish, and the fiber in beans. An egg a day is okay for most people, too (people with diabetes should limit their egg intake to three yolks a week, but egg whites are fine). Limit red meat—beef, pork, and lamb—and avoid processed meats—bacon, cold cuts, hot dogs, and the like—since over time, regularly eating even small amounts of these foods raises the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and colon cancer. Read more about healthy proteins.
- Use healthy plant oils. The glass bottle near the Healthy Eating Plate is a reminder to use healthy vegetable oils, like olive, canola, soy, corn, sunflower, peanut, and others, in cooking, on salad, and at the table. Limit butter, and avoid unhealthy trans fats from partially hydrogenated oils. Read more about healthy fats.
- Drink water, coffee or tea. On the Healthy Eating Plate, complete your meal with a glass of water, or if you like, a cup of tea or coffee (with little or no sugar). (Questions about caffeine and kids? Read more.) Limit milk and dairy products to one to two servings per day, since high intakes are associated with increased risk of prostate cancer and possibly ovarian cancer. Limit juice to a small glass per day, since it is as high in sugar as a sugary soda. Skip the sugary drinks, since they provide lots of calories and virtually no other nutrients. And over time, routinely drinking sugary drinks can lead to weight gain, increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, and possibly increase the risk of heart disease. Read more about healthy drinks, or read more about calcium, milk, and health.
- Stay active. The small red figure running across the Healthy Eating Plate’s placemat is a reminder that staying active is half of the secret to weight control. The other half is eating a healthy diet with modest portions that meet your calorie needs. Read 20 tips for staying active.

PROFESSOR: Last lecture we were talking about classes, and object-oriented programming, and we're going to come back to it today. I'm going to remind you, we were talking about it because we suggested it is a really powerful way of structuring systems, and that's really why we want to use it, It's a very common way of structuring systems. So today I'm going to pick up on a bunch of more nuanced, or more complex if you like, ways of leveraging the power of classes. But we're going to see a bunch of examples that are going to give us a sense. I'm going to talk about inheritance, we're going to talk about shadowing, we're going to talk about iterators. But before get to it, I want to start by just highlighting, sort of, what was the point of classes? So I'll remind you.
A class, I said, was basically a template for an abstract data type. And this was really to drive home this idea of modularity. I want the ability to say, I've got a set of things that naturally belong together, I'm going to cluster them together, I want to treat it like it's a primitive, I want to treat it like it's a float or an int or a string. Is this going to be a point or a segment or something different like that. So it's really a way, as I said, of just trying to cluster data together. And this is a notion of modularity slash abstraction where I'm treating them as primitives. But the second thing we talked about is that we also have a set of methods, using the special name method because we're talking classes. But basically functions that are designed to deal with this data structure. We're trying to group those together as well. So we cluster data and methods.
Second key thing we said was, in the ideal case, which unfortunately Python isn't, but we'll come back to that, in the ideal case, we would have data hiding, and by data hiding, which is sort of a version of encapsulation, what we meant was that you could only get to the internal pieces of that data structure through a proscribed method. Proscribed meaning it's something I set up. So data hiding saying, you would only access the parts through a method. And as we said, unfortunately Python does not enforce this. Meaning that I could create one of these data structures, ideally I'd have a method, that I'm going to see some examples of that I used to get the parts out, unfortunately in Python you could take the name the instance dot some internal variable you'll get it back. It is exposed. And this is actually just not a good idea. So I suggested in my very bad humor, that you practice computational hygiene and you only use appropriate methods to get the parts out. OK didn't laugh the joke last time, you're not going to laugh at it this time, I don't blame you. All right, and then the last piece of this is that we said the class is a template. When we call that class, it makes an instance. So class is used to make instances, meaning particular versions, of that structure, and we said inside the instances we have a set of attributes. Internal variables, methods, that are going to belong to that structure.
OK, so with that in mind, here's what I want to do. I'm going to show you a set of examples, and I want to warn you ahead of time, the code handout today is a little longer than normal because we want to build essentially an extended example of a sequence of examples of classes. We're going to see the idea, of which we're gonna talk about, of inheritance or hierarchy, in which we can have classes that are specializations of other classes. We're gonna see how we can inherit methods, how we can shadow methods, how we can use methods in a variety of ways. So this is a way of suggesting you may find it more convenient to put notes on the code handout rather than in your own notes. Do whatever you like, but I just wanted to alert you, we're going to go through a little more code than normal.
So, the little environment I'm going to build is an environment of people. I'll build a simple little simulation of people. So I'm going to start off with the first class, which I've got up on the screen, and it's on your handout as well, which is I'm going to build an instance, or a class rather, of persons. I'm going to draw a diagram, which I'm gonna try and see if I can do well, over here, of the different objects we're going to have. So I've got, a class, and by the way a class is an object. Instances are also objects, but classes are objects. We're gonna see why we want that in a second. Because I'm gonna build an object, sorry a class, called a person. Now, let's walk through some of the pieces here. The first one is, there's something a little different. Remember last time we had that keyword class and then a name, that name, in this case, person says this is the name for the class, and then we would have just had the semicolon and a bunch of internal things. Here I've got something in parens, and I want to stress this is not a variable. All right, this is not a def, this is a class. I'm going to come back to it, but what this is basically saying is that the person class is going to inherit from another class, which in this case is just the built-in Python object class. Hold on to that thought, it's going to make more sense when we look at a little more interesting example, but I want to highlight that. All right now, if we do this, as I said before, we can create a version of a person, let me just call it per, person.
OK? And what we said last time is, when we wanted to create an instance inside of this class definition, we've got one of those built-in things called init. I'm gonna again remind you, some of the methods we have, Underbar underbar init is going to be the thing that creates the instance. Actually slightly misspeaking, actually Python creates the instance, but it's one thing that fills it in. So in this case, I'm going to give it 2 arguments: Frank Foobar Now, you might have said, wait a minute, init here has 3 arguments: self, family name, and first name. So again, just to remind you, what we said happens here is that when I call this class, person, I'm creating an instance. We'll draw a little instance diagram down here. I'm going to give it the name per. And I should have said inside of person, we've got a set of things. We've got our underbar underbar init, we've got, what else do I have up there? Family name. And a bunch of other methods, down to say.
What happens inside of Python is, when we called the class definition, person, it creates an instance, there it is. Think of it as a pointer to a spot in memory, and then what we do is, we call, or find, that init method, up here, and we apply it. And the first argument self, points to the instance. So this object here is what self looks at. Now you can see what init's going to do. It says, oh, inside of self, which is pointing to here, let me bind a variable, which was, can read that very carefully, it's family underbar name, to the value I passed in, which was 4. Same thing with first name. OK, so the reason I'm stressing this is, self we do not supply explicitly, it is supplied as pointing to the instance, it's giving us that piece of memory. And that is what then gets created. So here's, now, the instance for per. OK, and I put a little label on there, I'm going to call that an isALink, because it is an instance of that class. God bless you.
All right, so once we got this, let's look at what we can do with person. That's why I built person here. And as I said, I've already bound basically, those two pieces. If I want to get a value out, I can give person, or per, rather, this instance, a messaging. In this case I want to get family, what did I say, family name out, now, again I want to stress, what is happening here? per is an instance, it's this thing here. When I say per dot family name, I'm sending it a message, in essence what that does is, it says, from here it's going to go up the chain to this class object and find the appropriate method, which was family name. It is then going to apply that to self, which points to this instance. And that allows it, therefore, is you can see on the code, to look up under self, what's the binding for family name, and print it back up. So self is always going to point to the instance I want and I can use it. OK what else do we have in here? We can get the first name, that's not particularly interesting.
We've got 2 other special methods: that's cmp and str. All right, cmp is our comparison method. And since I, I was about to say I blew it last time, I misspoke last time, a wonderful phrase that politicians like to use, I misspoke last time. Let me clarify again what cmp will do. Underbar underbar cmp is going to be the method you're going to use to compare two instances of an object. Now, let's back up for second. If I wanted to test equality, in fact I could use underbar underbar eq, under under. It's natural to think about an equality tester as returning a Boolean, it's either gonna be true or false, because something's either equal to or not. In many languages, comparisons also return Booleans, which is why I went down this slippery slope. For many languages, either it's greater than or it's not. But Python is different. Python use cmp, in fact it has a built in cmp, which is what we're relying on here. Where am I, right there. And what cmp returns is 1 of 3 values. Given 2 objects, it says if the first one is less than the second one, it returns -1, if it's equal it returns 0, if it's greater than, it returns 1.
So it allows you this broader range of comparisons. And if you think about it, cmp, you could apply on integers, you could apply it on floats, apply it on strings. So it's overloaded, it has the ability to do all of those. And in this case what we're saying is, given 2 objects, let's create a tuple of the first, sorry, family and first name of ourselves, and other is another object, family and first name of that, and then just use cmp to compare them. All right, so it's going to use the base pieces. OK, so it gives me a way of doing comparisons. And str we saw last time as well, this is cmp does comparison, and str is our printed representation.
OK. So what we've got now, is a simple little class. We've also got two methods there. I want to look at them, we're gonna come back to them, but they start to highlight things we can do with our classes. So I've built one simple version of it here, which is per. And notice I've got another method, right up here, called say. And say takes two arguments, for the moment the second argument, or the first argument's, not going to make a lot of sense, but say takes two arguments besides itself. It's going to take another object to which it's saying something and the thing to say. Since I only have one object here, I'm going to have person talk to himself. You may have met a few other undergraduates who have this behavior. I'll have him talk to himself and say, just some random message the faculty members occasionally worry about. OK, what does this thing do? Now you're going to see some of the power of this. Again, remember, I'm down here, I'm sending this the message say, it's going to go up the chain to find the say message in person. And what does say do, it says given another object and some string, it's going to return, oh, and interesting things, part of which you can't see on the screen. First what it does, is it gets first name of self. Remember self is pointing to this instance, so it's simply looks up that binding, which is Frank. It's going to create a string in which it adds to that the family name of self, and then another thing that says to, and then ah, I'm now going to send a message to the other object, saying give me your first name. Going to add that to the second piece, and you can see in this case it happens to be the same first and family name. And then at the end of it, which you can't see here but you can see in your handout, I just append the whole string, so it spits it out.
What's the point of this, other than I can get it to say things? Notice, I can now reference values of the instance. But I can also get values of other instances, by sending in a message. And that's why we have that form right there. And then it glued all together. If you think about this for a second, you might say, wait a minute, actually you might have said wait a minute a while ago, why am I just using the variable name there in the function over here? Well in fact, I could've used the function here, first name open close, right? It would have done the same thing. But because I know I'm inside the instance, it's perfectly reasonable to just look up the value. OK, I could have, although I don't want you to do it, have done the same thing there and used underbar, sorry, first name underbar, sorry, first underbar name, but that's really breaking this contract that I want to happen. I should send the message to get the method back out. So again the standard practices is if you know you're inside the object, you can just access the values. If you're doing it with any other objects, send it a message to get it out.
OK, now, that gives you an ability to say, let's look at one more example here, and then we're going to start building our hierarchy, which is, that this person can also sing. And we've got a little sing method here. And notice what it does, it's going to sing to somebody, I guess you're part of the Chorallaries. You're going to sing something, and notice what it does, it's simply going to use its say method, but add at the end of whatever's being said, just tra la la at the end. So this is now an example of a method using another method. Why would you want that? It's nice modularly. I have one method that's doing saying, I have another method that's just building on it. So if I have is person sing to themselves, not a highly recommended activity, it would help if I had it sing to itself, not sing to sing, sorry about that. Notice what it does. Looks like exactly like a say method, except it's got tra la la at the end. Don't worry I'm not going to sing to you. I'll simply say the words. Power of this, other than the silly examples. You see how I can access variables of the instance, how I can access variables of other instances, going to come back to that, and how I can use versions of my own methods to implement other methods. In this case sing is using say as part of what it wants to get out.
OK, so we got a simple little example. Now, let's start adding some other pieces to this. OK, and what do I want to add. Find my spot here. OK, we're going to add an MIT person. Sorry, machine is -- do this, let's go down. OK so I'm going to add an MIT person. Look at the code for second. Aha! Notice what this says. MIT person says it inherits from person. That is, that's the first thing in parens up there. It says, you know, class of MIT person is person. What that is saying is, that this is a specialization of the person class. Or another way of saying it is, we have a super class, in this case it's person. And we have a subclass, in this case its MIT person. And we're going to walk through some examples, but what it says is that that subclass of MIT person can inherit the attributes of the person class. Can inherit the methods, it can inherit variables.
OK, what does MIT person do? Well, here's 1 of the new things it does. It has a local variable called next id num, which is initially set to 0. See that up there. And then it's got some methods, it's got an init method, a get id method, a few other things. OK, let's run this. In particular, I go back down to this one. Let me just uncomment this and do it here. Assuming my machine will do what I want it to do, which it really doesn't seem to want to do today. Try one more time. Thank you, yep. Still not doing it for me, John. OK, we type it. No idea what Python doesn't like me today, but it doesn't. So we're gonna define p 1, I've lost my keyboard, indeed I have. Try one more time. p 1 MIT person, see how fast I can type here -- OK, now, let's look at what the code does, because again it's going to highlight some things. I called MIT person, push this up slightly, it's going to create an instance down here, I called p 1. And when I would do that, I'm gonna initialize it. So I've got, right up here, an initializer, init for MIT person, takes in the family name and the first name. Notice what it does. Huh. It says, if I'm sitting here at MIT person, I'm going to go up and inherit from person its init function and call it. And what am I calling it on? I'm calling it on self, which is pointing to this object, so I've still got it, and then I'm then going to apply the base initialization. And that does exactly what you'd expect, which is just going to create a binding for family name down here. As well as some other things. So this is an example of inheritance. MIT person inherits the init method from person, can get access to by simply referring to it, and I refer to it right there. And it's take the person class, get its init and apply it to my instance plus those things. So I'm just using the same piece of code
Notice the second thing it does. It says inside of self, I'm going to bind the local variable id name to the value of next id name in MIT person. Self is down here, id num, sorry, not id name. I'm going to bind that to the value that I find my going up to here, which is 0, and having done that, I simply increment that value. OK? So what has this done? It says I now have captured in the class, a local variable that I can keep track of. And when I use it, every time I generate an example, let me build another one. I make p 2 another MIT person. OK, I can do things like saying, what is the id number for each of these. First one is 0, second one is 1, which makes sense, right? I'm just incrementing a global variable. Now, things I want you to see about this. Now that I've got a beginning of a hierarchy, I have this notion of inheritance. I can ask a function inside one class to use a function from a class that it can reach by going up the chain. I just did it there. I can ask it to go get values of variables, right, so that looks good. What else do we have in person or MIT person? Well, we can get the id number, we just did. We have a thing to do with this string. Notice it's going to print out something a little different. In fact, there's a kind of funky form there. Which just says, if I want to print it out, I'm gonna create, what this says to do is, I'm gonna create an output template that has that structure to it, but where I see that percent s I'm going to substitute this value for the first one, that value for the second. So if I say, what is p 1? It says ok, MIT person Fred Smith. On the other hand, if I said, what is per, which is that thing I build earlier, it had a different string method, which is just print out person, those pieces.
All right, one last piece to this and we're going to add to it. Suppose I want Fred to say something. Say something to Jane. OK, he said it. Where's the say method? OK, Fred is an instance of an MIT person. where's the say method? Well, there isn't one there, but again, that's where the hierarchy comes in. Fred is this object here, I'm sending it the message say. That turns into going up the chain to this object, which is the class object, and saying find a say method and apply it to that instance. Fudge-knuckle, it ain't here. Don't worry about it, because it says if I can't find one there, I'm going to go up the chain to this method, sorry to this class, and look for a method there. Which there was one, I have a say method. It's going to use that say method. Apply to it. Well, you might say, OK, what happens if it isn't there? Well, that's where, remember I defined person to be an instance of an object, it will go up the chain one last time to the base object in Python to see is there a method there or not. Probably isn't a say method for an object, so at that point it's going to raise an exception or throw an error. But now you again see this idea that the inheritance lets you capture methods.
Now you might say, why not just put a say method inside of MIT person? Well, if you wanted it to do something different, that would be the right thing to do. But the whole notion here's that I'm capturing modularity, I've got base methods up in my base class. If I just want to use them I'm just going to inherit them by following that chain, if you like, basically up the track. OK, so we've got an MIT person, we can use that. Let's add a little bit more to our hierarchy here. I'm going to create, if I can do this right, a specialization of an MIT person, which is an undergraduate. A special kind of MIT person. All right, so if I go back up here, even though my thing is not going to let me do it, let's build an undergraduate. OK, there's the class definition for an undergrad. We're just starting to see some of the pieces, right, so in an undergraduate, where am I here, an undergraduate. OK, it's also got an initialization function. So if I call undergrad, I'm gonna make an undergrad here, again let me go back down here, line ug 2 it's making undergrad, Jane Doe. Now, what happens when I do the initialization here? Notice what goes on. It simply calls the person initialization method. All right, so I'm down here. I'm going to call the person initialization method, what did do? Sorry, the MIT person method, it calls the person method. Just walking up the chain, that's going to do exactly what I did with all the other ones, so I now have a family name and a first name. So I can, for example, say family name and get it back out. All right?
And then, other things that I can do, well I can set what year the person's in, I can figure out what year they're in, there's this unfortunate overflow error if you've hung around too long, but that's not going to happen to you. And I've now got a say method here, so let's look what happens if I ask the undergraduate to say something. OK, it's not a realistic dialogue I know, but, what did this method do? I asked this object to do a say. And notice what it does. It simply passes it back up to MIT person. There's that inheritance again. It's saying, I'm going to have my base say method say something. I'm going to say it to a person, but all I'm going to do because undergraduates in my experience, at least, are always very polite, I'm going to put "Excuse me but" at the front of it. OK, what am I trying to show you here? I know the jokes are awful, but what am I trying to show you here? That I can simply pass up the chain to get it. In fact, what method does the final say here? What class does it come from? Person class, yes, thank you. It goes all the way up to person, right, because MIT person didn't have a say. So I can simply walk up the chain until I find the method I want to have.
Now this is an example of shadowing. Not a great example, but it's a beginning example of shadowing, in that this same method for an undergraduate, shadows the base say method, it happens to call it, but it changes it. It puts "Excuse me but" at the front, before it goes on to do something. Now again, I could have decided here to actually copy what the original say method did, stitch all the other things together. But again, that loses my modularity. I'd really to only have to change it in one place. So by putting my say method up in person, I can add these nuances to it, and it lets me have something that has that variation. If I decide I want to change what say does, I only have to change it in one place. It is in the person class definition, and everything else will follow through for free.
OK, so now I've got an undergrad, right? Let's look at a couple of variations of what happens here. So first of all, I can -- yes?
PROFESSOR 2: Shadowing here is often sometimes called overriding.
PROFESSOR: Yes, thank you, because I'm going to do a pure example of shadowing in a second, John right. Also called overriding. Part of the reason I like the phrase shadow is, if you think about it as looking at it from this direction, you see this version of init before you see the other ones, or you see that version of say, but it is overriding the base say example. OK, so I can say, what does p 1, sorry, yes, what does undergrad look like? And I said wait a minute, MIT person, not undergrad, is that right? Well, where's the str method? I didn't define one in undergrad, so it again tracks up the chain and finds the str method here, so it's OK undergrads are MIT people most the time, so it's perfectly fine.
OK, now, I have built into this also these cmp methods. So I've got two examples. I've got undergrad, or ug. And then I've got poor old Frank Foobar back there, per person. So suppose I want to compare them? What do you think happens here? Compare sounds weird, right, I compare an undergraduate to a person. I don't know what that's doing, some kind of weird psychological thing, but what do you think happens in terms of the code here if I run this. I know it's a little hard because you got a lot of code to look at. Do I have a cmp method defined somewhere? Yeah. So, it's hard to know what it's going to do, but let's look at it. Hmm. Now sometimes I type things and I got errors I don't expect, this one I did expect. So what happened here? Well let's talk about what happens if I do that comparison I was doing, what was I doing? Ug greater than per? What unwinds into is, I'm going to send to ug, that instance, a cmp method. This is really going to become something like ug dot under under cmp under under applied to per. I think that's close.
What does that do? It says starting in ug, I'm going to look for the first cmp method I could find, which is actually sitting here. I had a cmp method in MIT person. If you look at your code, what does it do? It looks up the id numbers to compare them. Well the, ug has an id number because it was created along this chamber. Remember per over here was just created as a person. It doesn't have an id number, so that's why it complaints. Ok, happens if I do that? Compare per to ug. How many people think I get an error? Wow. How many people think I'm going to get either true or false out of this? A few brave hands. Why? Can I ask you, please? Why do you think I'm going to get a, doesn't matter whether it's true or false, why am I going to have something work this time that didn't work last time?
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly. And in case you didn't hear it, thank you, great answer, sorry, terrible throw. In this case I'm using per, that's the first part, so it's not symmetric. It's gonna use per to do the look up. And as it was said there, per over here goes up and finds a cmp method here which it can apply. In that case, it simply looked at, remember, it took the tuples of first and last name which are both defined here, and did some comparison on that. So this is a way of again pointing out to you that the things are not always symmetric, and I have to be careful about where do I find the methods as I want to use them.
Ok? All right. Let's add, I'm gonna do two more classes here. Let's add one more class, some people debate whether these are really people or not, but we're going to add a class called a professor. OK. Now what am I doing? I'm creating another version of class down here. Which again is an instance, or a subclass, sorry, not an instance, a subclass of an MIT person. I see that because I built it to be there. Again I've got an initialization that's going to call the person initialization, which we know is going to go up -- I keep saying that -- going to call the MIT person initialization, which is going to go up and call this one. So again I'm going to be able to find names. And I do a couple of other different things here. I'm gonna pass in a rank, full professor, associate professor, assistant professor, which I'm just going to bind locally. But I'm gonna add one other piece here, which is I'm gonna add a little dictionary on teaching. So when I create a professor, I'm gonna associate with it a dictionary that says, what have you been teaching?
And then notice the methods I create. I've got a method here called add teaching, takes, obviously a pointer to the instance. A term, which will just be a string, and a subject. And let's look at what it does right here. OK. In fact the call I'm going to make, I'm not certain I'm going to be able to get away with it, my machine is still wonderfully broken, all right, it is, let me just show you what the calls would look like. As you can see here I'm not going to be able to do them. But I'm going to add teaching, as a method call with this with a string for term, and a subject number. What is this going to do? Yeah, I know I'm just worried if I restart Python, I may not be able to pull the thing back in, so I'm going to try and wing it, John, and see if I can make it happen.
Right, what does that teaching do? It's got one of those try except methods. So what does it say it's going to do? It's going to go into the dictionary associated with teaching, under the value of term, and get out a list. And it's going to append to the end of the list the new subject. So it's going to be stored in there, is then going to be term, and a list of what I taught, in case I teach more than one thing each term. It's going to do that, but notice it's a try. If in fact there is no term currently in the dictionary, started out empty, it's going to throw an error, sorry, not throw an error, it's going to raise an exception. Which is a key error, in which case notice what I'm going to do, I'm not going to treat it as an error. I'm simply going to say, in that case, just start off with an empty, with an initial list with just that subject in and put it in the dictionary. As I add more things in, I'll just keep adding things to this dictionary under that term. And if I want to find out what I'm doing, well I can use get teaching, which says given the term, find the thing in the dictionary under that term and return it. If I get an error, I'm going to raise it, which says there is nothing for that term, and in that case I guess I'm just going to return none.
OK? And then the other two pieces we're going to have here, and we want to look at a little more carefully, I just wanted to show you that example, is a professor can lecture, and a professor can say something. Look at the say method, because this now add one more nuance to what we want to do here. And I think in interest of making this go, let me actually, since I'm not going to get my machine to do this right, let me create a couple of professors. If I look at what that is, it's an MIT person because I didn't have any separate string thing there, and we will create a more important professor. What rank do you want, John? Do you want to stay full?
PROFESSOR 2: Undergraduate.
PROFESSOR: Undergraduate, right, a lot more fun I agree. Sorry about that, and we can again just see what that looks like. And that of course, we'll print out, he's also an MIT person. But now here's what I want to do. I want to say something to my good colleague Professor Guttag. Actually I'm going to start a separate -- I'm going to say something to a smart undergraduate. So if I say, remember we have ug defined as an undergraduate, let me do something a little different here. Well let, me do it that way. It says, I don't understand why you say you were enjoying 6.00. Not a good thing to say, right, but if I say to my good colleague Professor Guttag. I have to spell say right, I know, I need help with this, what can I say? We flatter each other all the time. It's part of what makes us feel good about ourselves. Why is the sky blue? I enjoyed your paper, but why is the sky blue?
OK, terrible examples, but what's going on here? One more piece that I want to add. Here's my say method for professor, and now I'm actually taking advantage of to whom I am saying something. Notice again, what does it do? There's the self argument, that's just pointing to the instance of me. I'm passing in another argument, going to call it to who, in one case it was ug, in one case it was Guttag. And then the thing I want to say, ah, look what it does, it says, check the type. And the type is going to take that instance, I had an instance, for example, of a professor down here, and it's going to pick up what type of object it is. So if the type of the person I'm speaking to is undergrad, let's pause for second. Remember I started away back saying we're building abstract data types. Well, here's a great example of how I'm using exactly that, right? I've got int, I've got float, I now have ug, it's a type. So it's says if the object to whom I'm speaking is an undergrad, then use the same method from person where I'm going to put this on the front. On the other hand, if the object to whom I'm speaking is a professor, then I'm going to tag this on the front and use the underlying say method. On the other hand, if I'm speaking to somebody else, I'm just going to go lecture. All right, and when a professor lectures, they just put it's obvious on the end of things, as you may have noticed.
What's the point I want you to see here? I'm now using the instances to help me to find what the code should do. I'm looking at the type. If the type is this, do that. If the type is this, do something different, ok? And I can now sort of build those pieces up. OK, I said one more class. Notice what we're doing. I know they're silly examples, but, sorry, they are cleverly designed examples to highlight key points. What I'm trying to do is show you how we have methods inherit methods, how have message shadow methods, how we have methods override methods, how we can use instances as types to define what the method should do.
Let me show you one last class, because I'm gonna have one more piece that we want to use. And the last class is, sort of, once you've got a set of professors, you can have an aggregate of them. And I don't know, if a group of geese are gaggle, I don't know what a set of professors are, John. Flamers? I, you know, we've got to figure out what the right collective noun here is. We're going to call them a faculty for lack of a better term, right? Now the reason I want to show you this example is, this class, notice, it only is going to inherit from object. It actually makes sense. This is going to be a collection of things, but it's not a subclass of a particular kind of person. And what I want the faculty to do, is to be able to gather together a set of faculty. So if I go down here, grab this for second, and pull it down so you can see it. It looks like I'm not going to be able to run this because my machine is broken, but basically I'm gonna define a set of professors, and then I'm gonna create a new class called faculty. There's the definition of it. It's got an init. You can kind of see what it does. It's going to set up an internal variable called names, which is initially an empty list, internal variable called ids, which is empty, an internal variable called members, which is empty, and another special variable called place, which we're going to come back to in a second, initially bound to none.
OK, I've got a method called add which I'm going to use down here to add professors to the course 6 faculty. Here's what I want to add to do. First of all, notice I'm going to check the type. If this is not a professor, I'm gonna raise an error, a type error, it's the wrong type of object to pass in. The second thing I'm gonna do is say, if that's okay, then let me go off and get the id number. Now remember, that's right up here, so I'm asking the instance of the professor to go up and get the id number. And I want to make sure I only have one instance of each professor in my faculty, so if the id number is in the list of ids already, I'm going to raise an error, sorry, raise an exception as well, saying I've got a duplicate id. OK? And the reason that's going to come up is, notice what I do now. Inside of the instant self, I take the variable names and I add to it the family name of the person I just added. OK, notice the form. I'm using the method, there's the parens to get the family name of the person. I'm just adding it to the list. I've got the id number, I've added the ids, and I add the object itself into members. So as I do this, what am I doing? I'm creating a list, actually several lists: a list of ids, a list of the actual instances, and a list of the family names. And as a cost I want to add, that's why I can check and see, is this in here already or not?
Now, the last reason I want to do this is, I want to be able to support things like that. This is now different, right, this instance is a collection. I want to be able to do things like, for all the things in that collection, do something, like print out the family names. And to do that, I need two special forms: iter and next. OK, now let me see if I can say this cleanly. Whenever I use a for, in structure, even if it was on just a normal list you built, what Python is doing is returning an, what is called an iterator. Which is something that we talked earlier. It's keeping track of where are you in the list, and how do I get to the next thing in the list?
I'm going to do the same thing here, and I'm going to create it for this particular structure. So this little thing iter, when I call a for something in, one of these instances, it calls iter, and notice what it does. It initializes place to 0. That was that variable I had up there. That's basically saying I'm at the beginning of the list. It's a pointer to the beginning of the list, and it returns self. Just gives me back a pointer to the instance. That now allows me at each step in that loop to call next. And what does next do? Next says, check to see if that value is too long, if it's longer than, for example, the list of names, raise an exception called stop iteration, which the for loop will use to say OK, I'm done. I'm going to break out of the for loop. Otherwise, what am I going to do? I'll increment place by 1, that's going to move me to the next place in the list, and then in this case I'll just return the instance itself, right? Members is a list of instances, place I've incremented by 1, I take 1 off of it, I get to it. So iter and next work together. Iter creates this method, that's going to give you a pointer to the place in the structure, and then next literally walks along the structure giving you the next element and returning elements in turn so you can do something with it.
Right, so now what that says is, I can have classes that just have local variables. I can have classes that get methods from other variables, and I can also have classes that are collections. And I've supported that by adding in this last piece. OK once you have all of that, in principle we could start doing some fun things. So let's see what happens if we try and make all of this go. And let me, since I'm not going to be able to run it, let me simply do it this way. If I have my undergraduate, ug. I can -- sorry, let's not do it that way -- I can have undergraduate say things like -- all right, what did I just do wrong here? Do I not have undergrad defined? I do. Oh, I didn't have Grimson, sorry, it's me, isn't it? Thank you. The undergraduate very politely asks why he didn't understand, you can have the professor respond. Again, it simply puts a different thing into there. On the other hand, if Professor Guttag asks me something about understanding, I say I really like this paper on, you do not understand, it's a deep paper on programming languages 5, I think, John, isn't it? What else can you do with this thing, right? You can have an undergraduate talk to an undergraduate, in which case they're still polite. Or you could have -- sorry, let me do that the other way -- you could also have an undergraduate simply talk to a normal person. All right, but the good news is you know eventually you get it done, and when you're really done you can have the undergraduate be really happy about this, and so she sings to herself.
OK it's a little silly, but notice what we've just illustrated. And this is where I want to pull it together. With a simple set of classes, and the following abilities, an ability to inherit methods from subclasses, sorry from superclasses, that is having this hierarchy of things. I can create a fairly complex kind of interaction. I can take advantage of the types of the objects to help me decide what to do. And if you think about that, I know it sounds very straightforward, but you would do exactly that if you were writing earlier code to deal with some numerical problem. All right, if the thing is an integer, do this, if it's a float, do that, if it's a string, do something else. I'm now giving you exactly the same ability, but the types now can be things that you could create. And what I've also got is now the ability to inherit those methods as they go up the chain. So another way of saying it is, things that you want to come away from here, are, in terms of these classes. We now have this idea of encapsulation. I'm gathering together data that naturally belongs as a unit, and I'm gathering together with it methods that apply to that unit. Just like we would have done with float or int. Ideally, we data hide, we don't happen to do it here, which is too bad.
Basically we've got the idea of encapsulation. The second thing we've got is this idea of inheritance. Inheritance both meaning I can inherit attributes or field values. I can inherit methods by moving up the chain. I can also the shadow or override methods, so that I can specialise. And I do all of that with this nice hierarchy of classes. So what hopefully you've seen, between these two lectures, and we're going to come back to it in some subsequent lectures, is that this is now a different way of just structuring a computational system. Now, you'll also get arguments, polite arguments from faculty members or other experts about which is a better way of doing it. So I'll give you my bias, Professor Guttag will give you his bias next time around. My view, object-oriented system are great when you're trying to model systems that consist of a large number of units that interact in very specific ways. So, modeling a system of people's a great idea. Modeling a system of molecules is probably a great idea. Modeling a system where it is natural to associate things together and where the number of interactions between them is very controlled. These systems work really well. And we'll see some examples of that next week. Thanks.

Indonesia is known for being prone to natural disasters of all kinds, ranging from climatic (floods, drought) to geologic (earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis, volcanoes, etc.), biological (avian influenza) to man-made (deforestation, mining, conflicts). With an already high level of food insecurity, households' vulnerability to shocks is high as the assets and structures of communities are jeopardized by these complex emergencies and a general lack of disaster risk reduction and management. Over the past five years, more than 1,500,000 people have been directly affected by natural disasters, primarily in West Sumatera, West Java, Central Java, West Nusa Tenggara, East Nusa Tenggara and Papua. Following the tsunami of 2004, the government of Indonesia has become more aware of the risks, both real and potential, affecting the provinces, and has taken steps to build the capacity of its staff in disaster risk reduction.
Emergency preparedness and response has also become a priority for the Indonesian Church, specifically the national Caritas office—KARINA—and a growing number of dioceses. Various disasters over the past five years offered opportunities for the dioceses in those areas to contribute to the disaster responses and increase their response and management capacities. This has provided Catholic Relief Services Indonesia with greater opportunity to work with and support the local Church and other organizations to improve their capacity in emergency response programming.

These days, students come from all walks of life and enter college for a variety of reasons, and with a variety of expectations. Many of these students are acutely aware of the affect collegiate life will have on future career options, and use their college experiences to discover and refine a career path that will satisfy them. Other students are in the midst of their careers and either want to change career paths or are looking for job training to advance their careers.
Career planning is a valuable exercise for any of these students.
A good starting point in deciding what course of collegiate study would best prepare you for a career is to analyze very thoughtfully what particular skills are strengths for you. In general, are you adept at working with people, or numbers, or the written word, and so forth? What subjects in high school or activities since graduating have had the most appeal for you? You should make a list of the activities you enjoy and the subjects you like to read about or discuss.
Another valuable career planning activity is to read up on career information. Research careers that you are interested in and that would utilize your strengths. What type of education is required to get into the field? Do you need a graduate degree? Will you need to pursue a long internship or residency program? Are you willing to spend the time it takes to fulfill these requirements?
Remember, you don't have to have all the answers, but if you have an idea in mind, it can only help you. With possible careers in mind, you can research the college majors that are relevant. You can determine what colleges offer strong programs in your chosen majors, or if a career college would be a good option.

The Empowered Patient is a regular feature from CNN Senior Medical News Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen that helps put you in the driver's seat when it comes to health care.
While there's no ironclad way to keep hantavirus away, there are steps you can take to minimize the chances that it will hurt you or your family.
The virus is relatively rare: Only 602 cases have been reported in the United States since 1993, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Recently, six cases of hantavirus were reported among people who visited Yosemite National Park in California. Two of those infected people died.
However, it's very deadly: About half of all people who get hantavirus die of it, according to the National Institutes of Health.
Though some people do get it from camping, such as the recent Yosemite cases, many more people contract hantavirus in their own homes, according to the CDC.
The virus is spread by rodent droppings and urine. Here are some tips from the CDC and NIH for keeping hantavirus at bay:
1. Seal holes inside and outside your home to keep rodents out.
2. Trap rodents around your home.
3. While camping, sleep on ground cover and a pad.
4. When opening an unused cabin, open all doors and windows. Leave for 30 minutes, and when you return, spray disinfectant and then leave for another 30 minutes.
5. Know the signs: Early symptoms include chills, fever and muscle aches. Within one or two days, it becomes hard to breathe.

We all know stress is bad for you, but just how bad?
It would be unethical to intentionally subject people to extreme psychological duress in the name of science. But ongoing military operations offer opportunities to see what happens to people exposed to stressful situations.
Researchers in the Netherlands found the brains of soldiers who go into combat show impairment in function and structure upon returning, but that these effects largely go away over time.

Scene Recognition System
The passion of developers who transcend the barriers of the workplace and debate from every possible angle in pursuit of an even better technology
The Scene Recognition System is a completely new technology. We have heard that the development process was fraught with various difficulties.
“To achieve an ‘even better technology’ was a challenge the Scene Recognition System absolutely had to overcome. There were plenty of difficulties just to do that. First of all, since the development process required us to undertake simulations showing how certain types of image data we photographed could produce certain types of output, we had to start by taking huge volumes of sample photos to be used in the simulations. To do that, we made a special camera that could use a 1,005-pixel RGB sensor to read the photo data. We connected the camera to a computer and took photos of lots of scenes we supposed would also be taken outdoors, although it looked a little strange to passers-by.”
This technology could have never come about if you weren't persistent, right? How did the data processing, one of the primary focuses of development, work out?
“A huge number of calculations is necessary to perform Scene Recognition, and the data processing inside the camera was extremely busy. The same information from the 1,005-pixel RGB sensor required different calculation processes depending on whether it was being analyzed for AE or AF. It took considerable effort to put together the required algorithms or to give the microprocessor enough memory to operate efficiently.”
Do the various calculations have to take place instantly?
“Yes. Even a single action requires extremely complex, high-speed calculations. Continuous shots in particular represent the hallmark of a successful camera. The camera has to work at maximum capacity when this is being done in AF. When the mirror is down, light is read by the sensor, and the instant the mirror goes up, calculation results are fed back, and when the shutter is pressed, the camera has to finish all the work. To repeat these operations instantaneously, calculations for various types of information to be passed on need to occur in an instant.”
I see. So, calculations are necessary for every movement of the camera?
“Exactly. It's extremely difficult to get the hardware and the data obtained in simulations to work together. We don't have much difficulty making simulations on the computer, but we had a very hard time getting the actual mechanism to work based on the simulation data. In 3D-Tracking, for instance, subject tracking information and AF need to link up and work together, but it didn't work at all at the beginning. We thought we had debugged the program and got the calculations perfect, too, but there were so many unknowns in this pioneering technology, it took a long while for us to make it work. We tested various possibilities in this process of trial and error, and once we finally got it to work in the camera, everyone involved in development and engineering felt a sense of achievement.”
You have been involved mainly in the development of metering technologies since you joined Nikon, so in the development of the Scene Recognition System, you had to expand into other fields such as AF, didn't you. I'm very interested in how you approached those challenges.
“Everyone in the development team came from completely different jobs, but our departments were nearby and we were in an environment where we could talk to each other quite easily. When talk of this development project came up, we had lots of discussions between departments. Especially when the idea was first proposed, it came under criticism from people wondering whether there was any sense in even attempting such a high hurdle. Once we put our heads together and talked openly about how we felt, I think we created an ideal environment for making something better.”
You knew it would be difficult, but you didn't say it was impossible. It is an admirable testimony to the interest and passion all the developers had for this new technology.
“I think it really was thanks to the efforts of so many people that we were able to do this. In the process of turning this new technology into a viable product, there really was a tremendous amount of ambiguity from the original idea to the final specifications we decided on. There were so many things we couldn't know just through experiments on the desk. In this area we had some members in the company who were in charge of making test photos and giving us constant advice. They were just like test drivers for new cars. We received lots of ideas from the hands-on experience of these people. Real ideas from the field are indeed very different from theoretical ideas, and they were indispensable to our development efforts.”
The harder the road we travel, the greater is our joy at the end. Just to hear someone say they were able to take a photo they could never take before.
How long did it take your team to develop the Scene Recognition System?
- Speaking of his future endeavors, Mr. Takeuch enthusiastically says: I want to explore applications to various camera models by considering their specifications and target users.
“About three years including time for the original idea.”
The D3 and D300 equipped with the Scene Recognition System have been released. Looking back on the development process, where did you get the energy to overcome all those difficulties?
“It was really our strong desire to succeed in creating this system. The difficulty in developing the system was the scale of the expectations people had for this technology. This provided the support we need to overcome obstacles in the development process. Of course, we have considerable satisfaction in having developed the technology, but more than that we look forward to the reaction of users. Though we developed these cameras with high-end, professional users in mind, professionals have the ability to make do with cameras with few functions. So if professionals use these cameras and say they are really useful, that would be a mark of success for us. The aim of the Scene Recognition System really has been to enable people to take photos they could never take before.”
We also look forward to future applications of the Scene Recognition System, which has a lot of potential.
“As a core technology, we would like to adapt it to future camera models, considering their specifications and target users. We want to start looking into various applications that will meet those needs.”

## Instructions:

This assignment is worth either $20 \%$ or $25 \%$ of the final grade, and is worth a total of 75 points. All working must be shown for all questions. For questions which ask you to write a program, you must provide the code you used. If you have found code and then modified it, then the original source must be cited. The assignment is due by $5 \mathrm{pm}$ Friday $1 \mathrm{st}$ of October (Friday of Week 8), using Turnitin on Wattle. Late submissions will only be accepted with prior written approval. Good luck.

Problem 1.

[10 marks] In this exercise we will consider four different specifications for forecasting monthly Australian total retail sales. The dataset (available on Wattle) AUSRetail2021. csv contains three columns; the first column contains the date; the second contains the sales figures for that month, and the third contains Australian GDP for that month $\mathbb{1}$ The data runs from January 1992 to January 2021 .

Let $M_{i t}$ be a dummy variable that denotes the month of the year. Let $D_{i t}$ be a dummy variable which denotes the quarter of the year. The four specifications we consider are
\begin{aligned} &s_{1}: y_{t}=a_{0}+a_{1} t+\alpha_{4} D_{4 t}+\epsilon_{t} \ &S_{2}: y_{t}=a_{1} t+ um_{i=1}^{4} \alpha_{i} D_{i t}+\epsilon_{t} \ &S_{3}: y_{t}=a_{0}+a_{1} t+\beta_{12} M_{12, t}+\epsilon_{t} \ &S_{4}: y_{t}=a_{1} t+ um_{i=1}^{12} \beta_{i} M_{i t}+\epsilon_{t} \end{aligned}
where $\mathbb{E} \epsilon_{t}=0$ for all $t$

a) For each specification, describe this specification in words.
b) For each specification, estimate the values of the parameters, and compute the MSE, AIC, and BIC. If you make any changes to the csv file, please describe the changes you make. As always, you must include your code.
c) For each specification, compute the MSFE for the 1-step and 3 -step ahead forecasts, with the out-of-sample forecasting exercise beginning at $T_{0}=60$.
d) For each specification, plot the out-of-sample forecasts and comment on the results.

Problem 2.

[10 marks] Now add to Question 1 the additional assumption that $\epsilon_{t}  im \mathcal{N}\left(0,  igma^{2}\right)$. One estimator for $ igma^{2}$ is
$$\hat{ igma}^{2}=\frac{1}{T-k}  um_{t=1}^{T}\left(y_{t}-\hat{y}{t}\right)^{2}$$ where $\hat{y}{t}$ is the estimated value of $y_{t}$ in the model and $k$ is the number of regressors in the specification.
a) For each specification $\left(S_{1}, \ldots, S_{4}\right)$, compute $\hat{ igma}^{2}$.
b) For each specification, make a $95 \%$ probability forecast for the sales in April 2021 .
c) For each specification, compute the probability that the retail sales in April 2021 will be greater than $\$ 31 \mathrm{bn}$. According to the FRED series AUSSARTMDSMEI, what was the actual retail sales value for that month. d) Do you think the assumption that$\epsilon_{t}is iid is a reasonable assumption for this data series. Problem 3. [10 marks] Here we investigate whether adding GDP as a predictor can improve our forecasts. Consider the following modified specifications: \begin{aligned} &S_{1}^{\prime}: y_{t}=a_{0}+a_{1} t+\alpha_{4} D_{4 t}+\gamma x_{t-h}+\epsilon_{t} \ &S_{2}^{\prime}: y_{t}=a_{1} t+ um_{i=1}^{4} \alpha_{i} D_{i t}+\gamma x_{t-h}+\epsilon_{t} \ &S_{3}^{\prime}: y_{t}=a_{0}+a_{1} t+\beta_{12} M_{12, t}+\gamma x_{t-h}+\epsilon_{t} \ &S_{4}^{\prime}: y_{t}=a_{1} t+ um_{i=1}^{12} \beta_{i} M_{i t}+\gamma x_{t-h}+\epsilon_{t} \end{aligned} where\mathbb{E} \epsilon_{t}=0$for all$t$, and$x_{t-h}$is GDP at time$t-h$. For each specification, compute the MSFE for the 1-step ahead, and the 3-step ahead forecasts, with the out-of-sample forecasting exercise beginning at$T_{0}=60$. For each specification, plot the out-of-sample forecasts and comment on the results. Problem 4. [15 marks] Here we investigate whether Holt-Winters smoothing can improve our forecasts. Use a Holt-Winters smoothing method with seasonality, to produce 1-step ahead and 3-step ahead forecasts and compute the MSFE for these forecasts. You should use smoothing parameters$\alpha=\beta=\gamma=0.4$and start the out-of-sample forecasting exercise at$T_{0}=50$. Plot these out-of-sample forecasts and comment on the results. Additionally, estimate the values for$\alpha, \beta$, and$\gamma$which minimise the MSFE. Find the MSFE for these parameter vales and compare it to the baseline$\alpha=\beta=\gamma=0.4$Problem 5. [5 marks] Questions 1, 3 and 4 each provided alternative models for forecasting Australian Retail Sales. Compare the efficacy of these forecasts. Your comparison should include discussions of MSFE, but must also make qualitative observations (typically based on your graphs). Problem 6. [10 marks] Develop another model, either based on material from class or otherwise, to forecast Australian Retail Sales. Your new model must perform better (have a lower MSFE or MAFE) than all models from Questions 1,3, and$4 .$As part of your response to this question you must provide: a) a brief written explanation of what your model is doing, b) a brief statement on why you think your new model will perform better, c) any relevant equations or mathematics/statistics to describe the model, d) the code to run the model, and e) the MSFE and/or MAFE error found by your model, and a brief discussion of how this compares to previous cases. Problem 7. [15 marks] Consider the AR(2) process with drift $$y_{t}=\mu+\rho_{1} y_{t-1}+\rho_{2} t_{t-2}+\epsilon_{t}$$ where the errors follow an$\mathrm{AR}(1)$process $$\epsilon_{t}=\phi \epsilon_{t-1}+u_{t}, \quad \mathbf{u}  im \mathcal{N}\left(0,  igma^{2} I\right)$$ for$t=1, \ldots, T$and$e_{0}=0 .$Suppose$\phi$is known. Find (analytically) the maximum likelihood estimators for$\mu, \rho_{1}, \rho_{2}$, and$ igma^{2}$[Hint: First write$y$and$\epsilon$in vector/matrix form. You may wish to use different looking forms for each. Find the distribution of$\epsilon$and$y .\$ Then apply some appropriate calculus.]

Is there going to be a Logo Contest?
Are there plans or ideas floating around for a logo contest, or is that a Public-Beta stage thing?

Getting a logo is part of getting a design, which is something that happens when a site graduates out of public beta.
In short, not for a long time yet.
While the site is in beta it will keep this theme that it currently has.

Sites get a customized design when they near graduation and that is a long way off. The task at hand is to gather up a collection of high quality questions so this site can get out of Private Beta. Focus on that now.
When the site is nearing graduation, the designers will contact you for feedback on a potential design. Typically the design is created by the designers first and it is posted for feedback and suggestions. The process of when and how this happens has been in flux more recently, but typically a logo contest is not really part of that process. But who knows… I've been floating various suggestions about how to get the community looped back in that process. 

no matter if we are close to graduation or not, i'd like to submit this one as my proposition

it is:

easy to recognize
simple
contains stylised '3' and 'D' characters
refers to 'layers'
aligned to SE logo
can be color/gray/BW and still well recognized
can be simplified (pixelate) to create favico (min size 8x8 pixels ;)

first presented in this topic
https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/a/247/1211

I quite like this design, although I must be honest and say that I have enough blue tabs already in my browser :-). Another colour would be better, to be able to clearly distinguish the 3D Printing SE tabs from all of the other SE tabs that I have open. Raspberry have red, SO is orange/yellow, electrical is orangey-red. Someone told me once that the human eye is most receptive to green (although I am not sure if that is true), and from a distance - when reading writing on a white board for example, from the back of a class - red was the most feint, whereas green was the clearest.

now i get your nick :P but in terms of colors - it's just a proposition aligned to SE colors nothing else. it's just a form but the content is this stylized 3D, layers, common cup form and hot-end as a steam :)

Idea: generate N points in the 1x1 square in the first quadrant¶

1----

0   1   2   3



Compute the number of points which fall within the unit circle centered at 1.

The quarter-circle that's the part of the unit circle that's in the first quadrant has area $\frac{1}{4}\pi ×{1}^{2}=\frac{1}{4}\pi$$\frac{1}{4}\pi\times 1^2 = \frac{1}{4}\pi$, and the unit square has area 1, so about $\frac{1}{4}\pi$$\frac{1}{4}\pi$ of the random points should be within the quarter-circle.

We compute the ratio of the number of points in the quarter circle and the total number of random points, multiply it by 4, and get $\pi$$\pi$.

To test whether the point $\left(x,y\right)$$(x, y)$ is within the unit circle, we test whether ${x}^{2}+{y}^{2}<1$$x^2+y^2<1$ (since points inside the unit circle all are less than 1 unit away from the origin, so that ${x}^{2}+{y}^{2}<1$$x^2+y^2<1$.

A small preliminary note on generating random numbers¶

We can use random.random() to generate random numbers in the interval $\left[0,1\right)$$[0, 1)$. Every time random.random() is called, a new random number is generated.

In [1]:
import random

x = random.random()
y = random.random()
print(x, y)

0.9199110526377364 0.28585222076565997


Here is a little trick: we can use multiple assignment to simoultaneously assign random numbers to x and y:

In [2]:
x, y = random.random(), random.random()
print(x, y)

0.30163174845316 0.43737830722543325


Another aside: how to generate a random number between 5 and 12? The following will do the trick:

In [3]:
5+7*random.random()

Out[3]:
9.681080775786686

We are now ready to compute an approximation of $\pi$$\pi$:

In [4]:
import random
N = 1000000

2022: a year in moderation

As we say goodbye to the old year and welcome the new one, we have a tradition of sharing moderation stats for the preceding calendar year.
As most of you here are aware, sites on the Stack Exchange network are moderated somewhat differently to other sites on the web:

We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.
-- A Theory of Moderation

That doesn't eliminate the need for having moderators altogether, but it does mean that the bulk of moderation work is carried out by regular folks. Every bit of time and effort y'all contribute to the site gives you access to more privileges you can use to help in this effort, all of which produce a cumulative effect that makes a big difference.
So as we say goodbye to 2022 (and where did January go, right?) and dive head first into 2023, let us look back at what we accomplished as a community... by looking at some exciting stats. Below is a breakdown of moderation actions performed on 3D Printing over the past 12 months:

Footnotes
¹ "Community" here refers both to the membership of 3D Printing without diamonds next to their names, and to the automated systems otherwise known as user #-1.
² The system will suspend users under three circumstances: when a user is recreated after being previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.
³ A "destroyed" user is deleted along with all that they had posted: questions, answers, comments. Generally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.
⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.
⁵ Includes close flags (but not close or reopen votes). Community can handle these flags by at least one person voting to close a question that has a close flag.
⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.
⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).

Tombs of the sacrificers?
A few tombs share the characteristic of containing a few very specific objects
: full warrior equipment including a sword in its sheath, spear, shield and also a knife or cleaver (butcher's blade) and an axe with an eye handle, together with one or more small buckets, a bronze pan, a toolbox, and fragments of amphorae. One or other of these objects may be missing, depending on the chronology, but the assembly is still remarkable
. The trilogy of weapon(s)-small bucket(s)-axe/cleaver is always found and the general destruction of the weapons is reminiscent of the Gauls' sacred sites.
One of the axes fits perfectly into the wound in the skull of the murdered man discovered at the settlement and this similarity, together with the specific sets of metal objects, could indicate the tombs of sacrificers
. The replacement of the axe with the butcher's cleaver, at a time when hundreds of ewes were ritually slaughtered at the settlement, is another argument for viewing these remains as those of men of religion.

# Easy, but seems complicated

### Leaping antalope

Could someone solve these equations for me? It seems complex, but I believe there is a easy way to find out a, b, c, and d...

(1) 8a+4b+2c+d=11
(2) 27a+9b+3c+d=44
(3) 64a+16b+4c+d=110
(4) 125a+25b+5c+d=220
(5) 216a+36b+6c+d=385
Find a, b, c, and d.

Thanks~

### Tide

At first glance it appears you have too many equations.

Other than that, why don't you just try elimination?

3. Oct 16, 2004

### JasonRox

Also, some of them can be divided into smaller numbers to.

Some are also proportional and for that reason you can get ride of one equation.

Honestly take it nice and slow, so you make know mistakes, and you'll get it.

Note: Soon you'll learn about matrices and thank "godmath" for it.

### Tom McCurdy

Keep multiplying the equations by whole numbers to cancel out variables by subtraction like 2-1=A 3-2=B 4-3=C
then result B-A=X C-B=Y
Y-X
that should leave you with one varible equals a number

5. Oct 16, 2004

### Tom McCurdy

Solution

(1) 8a+4b+2c+d=11
(2) 27a+9b+3c+d=44
(3) 64a+16b+4c+d=110
(4) 125a+25b+5c+d=220
(5) 216a+36b+6c+d=385

(2)-(1)= (A)
(3)-(2)= (B)
(4)-(3)= (C)

(A)= 19a + 5b + c = 33
(B)= 37a + 7b + c = 66
(C)= 61a + 9b+ c = 110

(B)-(A)=(X)
(C)-(B)=(Y)

(X)= 18a + 2b = 33
(Y)= 24a + 2b = 44

(Z) = (Y)-(X)

(Z)= 6a=11
a=11/6

therefore
by Equation (X)
(X)= 18a + 2b = 33
18(11/6)+ 2b = 33
b=0

therefore
by equation (A)
19a + 5b + c = 33
19(11/6) + 5(0) + c = 33
c=-11/6

thefore by Equation 1
8a+4b+2c+d=11

8(11/6)+4(0)+2(-11/6)+d=11
d=0

Summary
$$a=11/6$$
$$b=0$$
$$c= -11/6$$
$$d= 0$$

### Tom McCurdy

indeed you need x number of equations to solve for x number of variables

in this case i needed 4 equations since there were four variables being solved for
a,b,c,d

7. Oct 16, 2004

### Prometheus

Take all of the equations and make them of the form d= ...
Then, you can put the two non d sides of the equation together to create 2 pairs in which d is elimintated entirely.

You can repeat with these 2 equations to eliminate one of the other variables. This will leave you with 2 variables.

You can use the 5th equation to start over with one of the other 4, to obtain another formula using 2 variables. Then, add them up to eliminate one of the variables. Once you have the value of one of the variables, you can fill it in the others, and repeat to discover the others.

# Align equations horizontally with related vertical cells

I have a table like this:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|r|}
\hline
\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Etumerkillinen}} \\
\hline
Tyyppi & Minimi & Maksimi \\
\hline
i8   & $-2^{7}$ & $2^{7}-1$\\
i16  & $-2^{15}$ & $2^{15}-1$\\
i32  & $-2^{31}$ & $2^{31}-1$\\
i64  & $-2^{64}$ & $2^{63}-1$\\
i128 & $-2^{127}$ & $2^{127}-1$\\
\hline
\end{tabular}


The table is rendered like this:

I would like to align the math equations in a way that the 2's, 1's and the negative signs are aligned horizontally in relation with each other. Is this possible and how would I achieve that?

• Welcome to TeX SX! If I understand well, you want the 2nb and 3rd columns cells to be internally left-aligned ang globally centred? May 7, 2020 at 8:38
• Be aware of the typo in the column Minimi the field -2^{64} May 7, 2020 at 13:01

I don't think you'll go wrong if you choose left-alignment for both data columns. To align the numbers in the second column on 2, - and 1, you could split the single column into three distinct sub-columns.

I would focus my efforts more on giving the table a more open "look", as is done on the right in the following screenshot.

• Nit-pick. In the right-hand image, the first column, beginning with "i", looks squished tightly up against the left edge, especially since the "T" in the column header has some "air" on the left and the "i" is so narrow that it almost looks cut off. May 7, 2020 at 19:01
• Good plan. I'd be tempted to indent the "i"s even a little more, maybe as much as 2pt. May 7, 2020 at 19:45
• It's true that it's an optical illusion, but it's more obvious in the table on the right because the rules delineating the table start at exactly the same place as the table contents. The table on the left has a buffer. May 7, 2020 at 19:58
• Much better now! The "i" still looks skinny, but that can't be helped (and it would be much worse in sans serif). May 7, 2020 at 20:07

You can define \2 macro and use it:

The cardinals were deadlocked. They had been deadlocked for 27 months, since 1292 when Pope Nicholas V died. There were only twelve cardinals and they were evenly divided between two factions of the Roman nobility. Neither side would give way. Each hoped for the perks that would accrue from having one of their number named pope.
And then a message arrived from the mountains. Peter Murrone, the hermit founder of the Celestines, a strict branch of Benedictines, warned that God was angry with the cardinals. If they did not elect a pope within four months, the Lord would severely chastise the church.
Eager for a way out of their deadlock, the cardinals asked themselves, why not elect Peter himself? Finally the cardinals could agree. In a vote that they declared to be "miraculous" they unanimously chose Peter.
When three of the cardinals climbed to his mountain roost to tell Peter he had been chosen, the hermit wasn't happy. All of his life, he had tried to run away from people. Dressed like John the Baptist, he subjected himself to fasts, heavy chains, and nights of prayer without sleep. But when the cardinals and his friend King Charles II of Naples insisted that he must accept the position for the good of the church, Peter reluctantly agreed.
Charles II prompted him to name a number of new cardinals--all of them from France and Naples, changing the consistency of the group which would elect future popes. Peter, who was too trusting, made many mistakes. A babe in political matters, he was used by everyone around him. The Vatican staff even sold blank bulls with his signature on them.
The business of the church slowed to a crawl because he took too much time making decisions. Within weeks it became apparent he had to resign for the good of the church. But could a pope resign? Guided by one of the cardinals, Benedetto Caetani, Celestine as pope issued a constitution which gave himself the authority to resign.
All sorts of rumors followed this resignation. Peter had built himself a hut in the Vatican where he could live like a hermit. Supposedly Caetani thrust a reed through the wall of the hut and pretended he was the voice of God ordering Celestine to resign. Since his mind was undecided as to his proper course, this trick is said to have convinced him.
Celestine stepped down on this day, December 13, 1294, having actually filled the position of pope only three months. He was replaced by Caetani who took the name Boniface VIII. Afraid that Peter would become a rallying point for troublemakers, Boniface locked the old man up. He destroyed most of the records of Celestine's short time in office, but he could not unmake the cardinals.
Peter escaped and wandered through mountains and forests. He was recognized and recaptured when he tried to sail to Greece, his boat having been driven back by a storm. The last nine months of his life he spent in prayer as a prisoner of Boniface, badly treated by his guards. When he died in 1296, rumor had it that Boniface had murdered him. He was about 81-years-old. In 1313, Pope Clement V declared him a saint.

Photogrammetry using pure rotation?
I have a set of 42 images made as a rotation around the object and it is failing to generate a model in Visual SFM. From what I can gather, the problem is that just doing a rotation is insufficient. There must photographs taken from above as well.
Is there any way to avoid the need for high angle shots, and just use rotational shots and still get a 3D model from Visual SFM?

This is not a problem specific to Visual SFM, but a general technical problem. The software cannot accurately determine the depth of the pieces which approach perpendicularity with the camera lens. The software uses those varying measurements and estimated angles to calculate the geometry. Check out the law of cosines.

"They tell me that isn't right," Harding said.
Judy Ellinghausen, archivist at The History Museum in Great Falls, agreed, calling such an account "unlikely." In all the reading she has done on the 1908 flood, she has seen no references to serious flooding in the center of town.
Great Falls was not the only community affected by the precipitation in June 1908.
Lewis and Clark County commissioners estimated the Helena area lost $100,000 worth of its roads and bridges, while the Tribune quoted a Fort Benton resident as saying the water had never been as high in that historic town along the Missouri as it was in 1908.
Great Falls still sports one clear public reference to the Flood of 1908 — a plaque located on a railroad overpass pier next to 6th Street North between Park Drive and River Drive North. The plaque on the east pier shows the peak water level of the June 1908 flood.
Based on that high-water mark, floodwaters would have intruded only a short distance into the Lower North Side residential area. However, the West Side was inundated with water in 1908, just as it was in 1964, another disastrous flood year for west Great Falls.
Harding said the worst recorded flooding on the Sun River, which runs through the West Side and connects to the Missouri River near the Meadow Lark Country Club area, occurred in 1964.
"The 1908 (flood) always was the granddaddy of them all until '64," Harding said. Along the Sun River, water levels were higher in 1964 "by about a foot and a half," than they were in 1908, he added.
Other notable floods in Great Falls occurred in 1953 and 1975, which gave rise to a theory that big floods took place in Great Falls every 11 years.
Before 1986 rolled around, much of west Great Falls formed a flood district, and contractors built a thick earthen dike to keep out any flooding.
Sun River dikes in Great Falls have yet to be seriously tested.

# The Particle at the End of the Universe

### Sean Carroll, 2012, Hillsboro 539.721

Mostly about the development of the Standard Model, mathless. There is a large "bandgap" between word salad physics descriptions and the full-mathematical graduate-level description, and very little in between. This is among the best word-salad books, but I hope to find one which at least includes some algebra, and better technical illustrations of the geometry. Many more drawings explaining symmetries would help.

Page 110 LHC, bunches collide 20 MHz. Hundreds of millions of collisions per second, up to 100 or more particles per collision, one megabyte per collision, "1000 1-terabyte hard drives per second"

• This compares to the data rate of scanning a stream of launch loop rotor bolts to 10 micrometer precision. This data would be compared to the prior history of the bolts, repeating every 8 minutes. Identifying "interesting" "evolving" defects that increase the probability of future failure for a bolt, then replacing that bolt in the stream, is a computation and pattern recognition problem on a similar scale to LHC particle detection. Launch loop will exploit many technological advances created by the genius researchers at LHC.

# The Big Picture

## 2016, Beaverton, 576.83 CAR

This is philosophy, not science as such. Trying to turn science into "emotional meaning" is difficult; "is" is not "ought". I checked it out hoping to learn about why cosmologists chose the models they do, and why those models are absurdly oversimplified; perhaps the message is that they choose oversimplified models so the can write emotional philosophies like this book.

My own view is that nature in the miniature is rule-driven, but those rules have extremely complex and baroque, with surprising non-obvious outcomes. Nature at maximum scope is far more complex, but difficult and expensive to observe, so there is still a wilderness for the philosophers to hypothesize the existence of islands of philosophical orderliness. Spherical cows have been banished from the Earth and from our particle colliders, but they still orbit at the extremes of space and time.

Or, I'm rectocrainially inserted, and I should devote more hours to reading books like this. That would leave less time to read books with math in them.

The appendix has some math, the equation for the standard model "action", page 437:

W = { \Huge \int _{\large {k<\Lambda} } } { \large { [Dg][DA][D\psi][D\Phi] } } ~ exp \Bigg\{ ~ i ~ { \Huge \int } d^4 x  qrt{-g} \Bigg[ { { \large { m_p^2 \over 2} } ~ R - { \large {1 \over 4} } { \large ~ F_{\mu\nu}^a ~ F^{a\mu\nu} + ~ i ~ { \overline { \psi ^{  mall i } } } ~\gamma^\mu ~ D_\mu \psi^{  mall i } + \left( { \overline { \psi_{ mall L}^{ mall ~ i } } } ~ V_{ij} ~ \Phi ~ \psi_{ mall R}^{  mall ~ j } + h.c.\right) - | D_\mu ~ \Phi |^2 - V(\Phi) } }\Bigg] \Bigg\}

# Shreve I-1: Binomial asset pricing model

Wherein we give a slightly more intuitive version of the central replication derivation. Suppose we have a derivative security (which here really just means a random asset) worth $V_1(\omega_1)$ at time 1 and seek to determine its fair price at time 0, $V_0$. We will have $V_0=X_0$ where $X_0$ is an as-yet unknown amount of money that will be needed to replicate the security.

The security presumably depends, whether positively or negatively, on a stock valued at $S_t$ at time $t$. So to replicate the security we buy some as-yet unknown amount $\Delta_0$ of shares of the stock.

((The whole thing is easier in the case where interest rates are $r=0$. Say the security returns either 10 or 17 depending on whether the stock is at 5 or 2, respectively. Then we just seek to express the security as a linear function of the stock, i.e. we seek numbers $\Delta_0$ and $c$ such that
$$\Delta_0(5\text{ or }2)+c = \text{10 or 17},$$
and then value the security at $\Delta_0 S_0+c$.

If we find “risk-neutral” probabilities under which the stock has expected value equal to its current value (these must exist, i.e., we must have $dS_0<S_0<uS_0$, or else all money should be taken out of the money market and invested in the stock), then the price of the security is just the expected value of the security under these probabilities. [Proof: First, this is true if the security is just equal to the stock, by definition of risk-neutral probabilities. Then as we saw above a general security is a linear function of the stock, and expectations preserve linear combinations.] The main advantage of this is not that we believe in a risk-neutral world — we might as well have used a world where the risk premium $\mathbb E S_1/S_0$ is 10% or some other fixed easy-to-compute number (well, assuming we could be sure that $\tilde p$ and $\tilde q$ would exist in that case too!) (and, well, dividing 1 by is significantly easier than dividing by any other number) — but that once we have the risk-neutral probabilities we can calculate the prices of many securities as long as they are all based on the same underlying set of stocks.
))

This leaves us with the cash position, i.e. money on hand, of $X_0-\Delta_0 S_0$, which of course we invest in the money market, i.e., we let somebody (such as a bank) borrow the money in return for paying us interest.

At time 1 the value of our portfolio (of stock and money market accounts) is

$$X_1(\omega_1) = \Delta_0 S_1(\omega_1) + (1+r)(X_0-\Delta_0 S_0)$$
Here $\omega_1\in\{H,T\}$, so we actually have two equations in the two unknowns $\Delta_0$, $X_0$. We impose $V_1(\omega_1)=X_1(\omega_1)$ for both $\omega_1$, and we assume $V_1(\omega_1)$ is known for each $\omega_1$.

Rather than relying on magic intuition, we solve this system of equations, using the fact that the inverse of the matrix
$$\left[\begin{array}{rr} a & b \\ c & d \\ \end{array}\right]$$
is
$$\frac{1}{ad-bc} \left[\begin{array}{rr} d & -b \\ -c & a \\ \end{array}\right]$$
Only then is it time to bring in the risk-neutral probabilities $\tilde p$ and $\tilde q$. Namely, we are curious whether there exist probabilities so that the expected value of the stock is just the return from the money market. Under real-world probabilities this should not happen, since it would make it needlessly risky to invest in stocks.

Then it turns out that, lo and behold,

the risk-neutral-expected return of our derivative security is equal to the money market return of… our sought-for time 0 price of the security.

So from these risk-neutral probabilities we can calculate the value $V_0$ of the security, using $(1+r)V_0 = \tilde{\mathbb{E}} V_1$.

What leadership traits can we learn from wolves? In The Wisdom of Wolves author Twyman Towery shares the milieu of the wolf pack where teamwork, loyalty and communication are the norm rather than the exception. Whether it�s their traits of curiosity, perseverance, loyalty or play, wolves exist for the survival of the pack - a lesson humans can apply in business, family or personal relationships. The Wisdom of Wolves shows us that not only has the teamwork of the wolves among themselves been critical to their success, but the teamwork between humans and wolves has helped boost the life environment for both species. The Wisdom of the Wolves provides food for thought: The strength of the pack is the wolf and the strength of the wolf is the pack.

New Zealand grasshoppers belong to the subfamily Catantopinae. A number of species are present including the common small Phaulacridium of the more coastal areas, the larger species of Sigaus of the tussock lands, and the alpine genera Paprides and Brachaspis, which include some quite large species. These inhabit the alpine areas of the South Island, some preferring scree and others tussock areas. They apparently survive the rigorous alpine winter conditions both as nymphs and as adults, and it is possible that they can withstand complete freezing. All species are plant feeders and lay batches of eggs or pods in short holes in the ground which they excavate with their abdomen. After hatching, the young nymphs moult four or five times before becoming adult.

Is everything related to (or for the purpose of) 3D printing such as 3D scanning as well as 3D designing in-scope on this site?
In addition to this: Is photogrammetry and 3D scanning on-topic?
Shouldn't this site be called "3D manufacturing" or something broader? As 3D printing suggest only "printing" and not everything related to 3D printing such as 3D scanning or even 3D designing. I suppose that is off-topic? Is this scope defined somewhere?
Is everything related to (or for the purpose of) 3D printing such as 3D scanning using photogrammetry, NeRF or other techniques as well as 3D designing in-scope on this site?
I think both 3D scanning as well as 3D designing should be on-topic here.

This was  originally a 3D Printing site, and it still is.
However, then when certain questions were asked, that weren't about 3D printing (but which also didn't fit on any other site, i.e. Engineering), but were about similarly related topics (i.e. CNC, or cartesian laser etching machines), where (the particular aspects of) the technology that was asked about was essentially the same, it didn't make that much sense not to answer them, and so they became allowed, and so on - yes, there was (and sometimes still is) some mission creep.
All of this was covered by (amongst others) these three "umbrella" posts (in the following order):

Game plan - What is on-topic?
On-topic has been updated - finally!
On-topic page is finally finished (again...)

So, the on-topic debate was finally (?) settled.
Yes, the on-topic subjects are maybe wider that the original "3D Printing site" concept. However, IMHO, changing the name at this late stage might be a bit drastic (possibly during beta stage is the latest opportunity for a name change?)... plus, the majority of the questions that hit the site are still predominately about 3D printing, as the first line of the on-topic page states:

Please make sure that your questions are intrinsically 3D printing oriented.

3D scanning and 3D design are on-topic here, so long as the end result is (stated to be) a 3D printed model.
It should also be noted that 3D scanning is explicitly listed in the on-topic page.
If you would like to suggest a broader scoped "Manufacturing" site for Stack Exchange, then Area 51 is the place to go. There was a Digital Fabrication site and a Personal Manufacturing site but both of these apparently failed to get out of Beta. This site (with a narrower remit) took a long time to get out of Beta (see What does it take to get out of Beta stage?), and which was thankfully achieved, see We're graduating!, due to the community successfully keeping the site centered around a 3D printing ethos.

That sounds great and then I saw this Stack site https://blender.stackexchange.com/. What an overlap. I really think that for those communities should merge to create one big "3D" site (manufacture or "print", scan, design). This site doesn't seem to have many active users IMHO.

Regarding 3D scanning and design.

What an overlap. I really think that for those communities should merge to create one big "3D" site (manufacture or "print", scan, design).

LabelIn the autumn of 1870, in the midst of the Franco-Prussian War, Monet and his wife left France for exile in London, where they remained until June 1871. There the artist painted this panorama of a park in the heart of the city. In later years Monet would return to London, painting numerous views of city sights, including the Houses of Parliament.

Protecting your skin and checking it for changes are keys to preventing another melanoma or catching one in an early, treatable stage.
Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays produced by the sun increases your risk of melanoma. Here’s how to protect your skin from the sun’s UV rays:
- Cover your skin with clothing, including a shirt and a hat with a broad brim.
- When outside, try to sit in shady areas.
- Avoid exposing your skin to the sun between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. standard time or 11:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. daylight saving time.
- Use sunscreens with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or more on skin that will be exposed to the sun.
- Wear sunglasses with 99% or 100% UV absorption to protect your eyes.
- Don't use sun lamps or tanning booths.
Check your skin regularly and have someone help you check areas you can’t see, such as your back and buttocks, scalp, underneath the breasts of women, and the backs of the legs. If you notice a new, changing or an irregular-looking mole, show it to a doctor experienced in recognizing skin cancers, such as a dermatologist. This may include large, irregular shape with a border that is not smooth and even, more than one color, or irregular texture. Your doctor may monitor the mole or recommend removing it
Contact your doctor if you discover a mole that is new has changed or looks suspicious: large or of irregular shape, color, or texture.

THURSDAY, July 19 (HealthDay News) -- You may think of your birthday as only being important to your age and the possible presence of candles, cards and cake, but a new study suggests a link between your month of birth and longevity.
Researchers found that those who were born between September and November from the years 1880 to 1895 were more likely to reach the 100-year mark than their siblings who were born in March. The study does not prove a cause-and-effect link, just an association.
The meaning of the findings is unclear, and a researcher who studies lifespan called them mostly irrelevant to modern times.
But, Leonid Gavrilov, from the Center on Aging at the University of Chicago, who wrote the study with his wife, Natalia Gavrilova, said the findings point to the importance of the environment in which a child is conceived and later grows.
"We believe that avoiding any potential sources of damage to developing fetus and child may have significant effects on health in later life and longevity," Gavrilov said. "Childhood living conditions may have long-lasting consequences for health in later life and longevity."
The researchers looked at 1,574 centenarians -- people who reached the age of 100 -- in the United States. They found that those people born between September and November had about a 40 percent higher chance of living to 100 than those born in March.
Of course, the chances that people born in 1889-1895 would even reach the century mark was very low to begin with. Of those born in 1900 who were still alive at 50, just a third of 1 percent of men made it to 100, and just shy of 2 percent of women accomplished the feat, Gavrilov said.
Why might month of birth -- or month of conception -- affect how long someone lives? One possibility is that seasonal diseases played a role, Gavrilov said.
S. Jay Olshansky, a professor of public health at the University of Illinois at Chicago who's familiar with the findings, said the study is not newsworthy. "The results are probably valid, but largely irrelevant in our modern world since they apply to birth months from more than a century ago."
Regardless of the month someone was born or conceived, the odds are slim that you'll live to be 100. "This prospect has been rising through the 20th century, but not dramatically," Olshansky said.
At best, he said, "this research might offer a partial and extremely small explanation for a small fraction of why some people conceived and born more than a century ago lived for 100 years."
What does all this mean for your chances of living to 100 if you were born around the fall or -- perhaps less luckily -- in March? Good question -- and one that won't be answered until people around your age start hitting the century mark.
The study appeared in the Journal of Aging Research.

# Antennas

### Help Support Homebuilt Aircraft & Kit Plane Forum:

#### Spaceclam

##### Member
Hello,
I have a New-to-me flybaby that was fitted years ago with a whip antenna mounted behind the headrest, and connects to a hand held radio. This airplane is about 30 years old, and one of its issues is radio noise. I have to keep the squelch all the way up, and sometimes it causes me to miss transmissions. It’s not engine noise. It’s more like aliens screaming in my head, and the noise is far louder than the transmission level. The radio works just fine by itself, but there isn’t really much room in the cockpit to use the handheld radio antenna and I like my radio mounted as it is

Seeing as there is corrosion at the base of the antenna and the connector is visibly discolored, I’d like to just replace it all and see if it helps. In looking at antennas, there appear to be nearly identical models ranging from $75 to$1500+. Is there some compatibility issue I am not aware of? Does it need to be sized to work with the lower-power handheld unit? What should I buy?

Been using these antenna's since the article in Sport Aviation. They work great, low cost, light weight and no drag.

Is this noise all the time, during all received transmissions, or only when you key the mike? If it's the latter, it may be a simple matter of the external antenna being too close to the radio. Fortunately you can put an antenna anywhere in a Fly Baby. It doesn't need to be externally mounted, because the wood/fabric construction won't affect your signal. I would try something as cheap and simple as this, just to test the possibilities:

The noise is not when the mic is keyed. It just happens randomly, even when the engine is off. I’ll give one of those a try. Also, any thoughts/comments/suggestions on the connector and wire? How long can the wire be? Do they make 90degree connectors so it doesn’t put so much strain on it?

Thanks,

If it's breaking squelch with no transmissions in the area, then either there's something wrong with the radio or you've got excessive RF or electrical noise in the a/c.

If it were me, before spending money I'd try to find the source of the problem. Things to look for/think about:
If it's an ancient engine, are the mags & plug wires shielded?
Are your P-leads properly shielded and terminated? (Whole chapter there...)
Is there a generator/alternator? If so, does turning it off improve things?
Is the shield on the antenna coax properly terminated *on both ends*?
Is the antenna grounded properly to the airframe?
Not directly related to a noise problem, but does the antenna have a ground plane? (doubtful if it's on the fuselage top behind the headrest)

Just a few things that came to mind in the time it took to type them.

I probably should have mentioned -this aircraft has no electrical system. So given the noise when the engine is off... that pretty much rules everything out besides antenna and connections. I think?

#### rv7charlie

A comm antenna can be as simple as stripping about 22" of shield off a piece of coax, and attaching 3 or 4 22" long radial arms attached to the shield at the strip point: 1/4 wave antenna Now it it will only be maximally efficient at one frequency, but it will 'work'.

If the radio is breaking squelch without the engine running and in receive mode (not transmitting), and there's no electrical system, it's hard to understand where the noise is coming from, except from the radio itself. Does it have the problem on multiple frequencies, or just your local active frequency? Are you doing the test out in the open, well away from a hangar or other building that might have fluorescent or LED lights, or other noise generators? The fluorescent lights in my hangar drive my handheld crazy, unless I get 20-30 feet away from them and outside the hangar. Have you verified the integrity of the coax, from the connector at the radio end to the connector at the antenna? Is the noise the typical 'white noise' that you hear from any comm radio when you disable the squelch, of does it have any different characteristics? 'aliens screaming in my head' does not sound like normal open squelch. If you're getting a howling or squealing sound, that almost sounds like it's interacting with another radio that's transmitting; the sound you get when one pilot 'steps on' another's transmission.

Kinda hard to 'remote troubleshoot'; just trying to give you some ideas on things to check.

Have you tried a different radio? Maybe borrow one from a friend? It'd be a shame to mess with wiring if the radio is the problem. From what you're saying though, replacing the antenna/wiring is probably a good idea either way. Make sure it's a 50 ohm cable. TV antenna cables can look identical, but they aren't 50 ohm, which is what you should use for the aircraft band. Make sure you have good ground connections at both ends if you fabricate your own cable. Normally you'd make the cable run as short as practical, but don't go overboard trying to save every inch. Prepackaged antenna/cable combinations might be longer than you need, but they're probably acceptable for your application, especially since you have no electrical system.

Might I also suggest you get a copy of Bob Nuckolls' Aeroelectic Connection if you can? Much of it won't apply to you since you don't have an electrical system, but it's still a great reference book to have. Much of it applies to vehicles other than airplanes too.

EDIT: This isn't bad to have either:

Oh, and the specific cable type depends on the application. RG 400 is fantastic antenna cable, but it would be incredible overkill for what you're doing. RG 142 is good, but RG 58 will probably do you just fine.

The road to 'civilisation' is paved with bad intentions.
Infestation, in'fes•ta'tion n. the state of being invaded or overrun by pests or parasites. Do people inhabit the lands and forests that they have been living in for thousands of years or do they infest them? The answer to this no-brainer of a question might well lie at the root of the problem being faced by the Jarawas in the Andaman Islands today. The video showing the Jarawa women dancing on the Andaman Trunk Road, apparently for food, is just the latest manifestation of a malaise that is so deep that one might well argue that there is no hope for the Jarawa.
In 1965, the Ministry of Rehabilitation, Government of India, published an important document related to the Andaman & Nicobar Islands: ‘The Report by the Inter Departmental Team on Accelerated Development Programme for A&N Islands.' The contents of the report and their purpose were evident in the title itself — it laid out the roadmap for the development of these islands and set the stage for what was to happen over the decades that have followed.
This little known report of less than a 100 pages in size is remarkable for the insight it provides into the thinking and the mindset of the times. There is what one might call a shocker on every page of this document and here is a just a sampling:
Page 26: …The Jarawas have been uniformly hostile to all outsiders with the result that about half the Middle Andaman is treated as a Jarawa infested (emphasis added) area which is difficult for any outsider to venture… With the present road construction and the colonisation of the forest fringes, friction has become more frequent, and no month passes without a case of attack by the Jarawas.
Page 69: The completion of the Great Andaman Trunk Road would go a long way to help in the extraction of forest produces...
A nation that had just fought its way out of the ignominy of being a colony was well on the way to becoming a coloniser itself. And those that came in the way could only be pests or parasites infesting the forests that had valuable resources locked away from productive use.
It is also pertinent to note here that in 1957 itself, more than a 1000 sq. km of these “Jarawa infested” forests of South and Middle Andaman had already been declared protected as a Jarawa Tribal Reserve under the provisions of the Andaman and Nicobar Protection of Aboriginal Tribes Regulation (ANPATR) — 1956. The 1965 report was in complete violation, or was a result of complete ignorance of this legal protection to the Jarawa and the forests that they have inhabited for thousands of years.
The seeds that were sown then have bloomed into myriad noxious weeds today and if one knows this history, the latest video that has generated so much heat is not in the bit surprising. Much space in the media, both print and electronic, has been occupied in the last few days by a range of claims and counter claims — about the date of the video, about the police involvement in its making, the role of tour operators and about fixing blame and responsibility. A little known fact that lies at the root of the issue has been all but forgotten — the existence of the Andaman Trunk Road, where this infamous video was shot about three years ago. The Andaman Trunk Road that the 1965 report offered as a good way of extracting resources from the forests of the Jarawa had been ordered shut by a Supreme Court order of 2002.
It's been a decade now and in what can only be called audacious defiance, the administration of this little Union Territory has wilfully violated orders of the highest court of the land. A series of administrators have come and gone but contempt for the Supreme Court remains.
Whenever asked about the order, the administration has tried to hide behind technicalities of interpreting the court order and arguing that the court had never ordered the road shut in the first place. They forget that in March 2003, a few months after the SC orders had been passed, they had themselves filed an affidavit with a plea to “permit the use/movement through the Andaman Trunk Road.” If it was not ordered shut, why the plea to keep it open? A few months later, in July 2003, the Supreme Court appointed Central Empowered Committee reiterated explicitly that the court orders include those for the closure of the ATR in those parts where it runs through the forests of the Jarawa Tribal Reserve. The A&N administration has clearly violated the court's order both in letter and in spirit.
It is a spirit that was evocatively articulated by Dr. R.K. Bhattacharchaya, former Director of the Anthropological Survey of India, in a report he submitted to the Calcutta High Court in 2004. “The ATR”, he said, “is like a public thoroughfare through a private courtyard… In the whole of human history, we find that the dominant group for their own advantage has always won over the minorities, not always paying attention to the issue of ethics. Closure of the ATR would perhaps be the first gesture of goodwill on part of the dominant towards an acutely marginalized group almost on the verge of extinction”.
The video in all its perversity offers us another opportunity, when all others in the past have been brushed aside either due to ignorance, arrogance or then sheer apathy. It's still not too late to make that ‘gesture of goodwill' because otherwise there will be many more such videos down the years and much worse will follow. The lessons from history are very clear on this. And it will hardly be a consolation that a few people will be left saying we told you so.
(The writer is associated with Kalpavriksh, one of the three NGOs whose petition before the Supreme Court resulted in orders for the closure of the Andaman Trunk Road in 2002. He is also the author of Troubled Islands — Writings on the indigenous peoples and environment of the A&N Islands.)

Henry Robinson has created an excellent series of articles on consensus protocols. Henry starts with a very useful discussion of what all this talk about consensus really means: The consensus problem is the problem of getting a set of nodes in a distributed system to agree on something - it might be a value, a course of action or a decision. Achieving consensus allows a distributed system to act as a single entity, with every individual node aware of and in agreement with the actions of the whole of the network.
In this article Henry tackles Two-Phase Commit, the protocol most databases use to arrive at a consensus for database writes. The article is very well written with lots of pretty and informative pictures. He did a really good job.
In conclusion we learn 2PC is very efficient, a minimal number of messages are exchanged and latency is low. The problem is when a co-ordinator fails availability is dramatically reduced. This is why 2PC isn't generally used on highly distributed systems. To solve that problem we have to move on to different algorithms and that is the subject of other articles.

Inspecting Heating Systems & Carbon Monoxide
Carbon monoxide poisoning has been on the rise in recent years, and it stems in large part from the home’s heating system. At first glance, modern heating systems may seem the same as those that have been used safely for years. However, there are some key differences that make today’s homes more susceptible to carbon monoxide buildup. As a home inspector, it is important to understand heating systems, what causes toxic gases to be present in the home, and how to prevent it.
In a nutshell, toxic gases in the home can be attributed to the following common situations:
- Today’s houses are more air-tight. Homeowners are aware of the cost of heating drafty homes and take steps to seal up windows, doors and other areas of air-infiltration. Consequently, there is less fresh air coming into a home and not as many pathways for stale or polluted air to leave it. In addition, when furnaces and boilers are starved for of the oxygen needed to burn fuels completely, carbon monoxide is produced.
- Manufacturers have designed new, high technology heating appliances with greater efficiency to help us save money, conserve natural resources and decrease environmental pollution. However, the new breed of high efficiency gas and oil furnaces- when vented into existing chimney flues- often do not perform at an optimum level. The difference in performance creates conditions that allow toxic gases to enter living spaces more easily.
The above conditions point out a number of older, ongoing problems that still require detection by a professional home inspector as well as correction in order to prevent toxic gases from filtering into the house. These include damaged or deteriorating flue liners, soot build-up, debris clogging the passageway, and animal or bird nests obstructing chimney flues.
What can you tell your home inspection clients about preventing these problems from arising? AHIT recommends that heating systems be tuned-up on an annual basis by a qualified HVAC contractor and that chimneys/flues be evaluated by a Certified Chimney Sweeper to ensure the entire system is operating properly and safely.

The Southern California Bight and its offshore islands are a unique natural resource with many sensitive and endemic plants and animals. This area is also an expanding urban center for the nation. The corresponding elimination and degradation of coastal habitats have created a need for scientifically guided management.
The Channel Islands Field Station has cooperative agreements with Channel Islands National Park in Ventura, Calif., and the University of California, Santa Barbara, that facilitate collaboration between field station scientists and university and park biologists. The linkage with the university also provides opportunities to supervise graduate students in marine ecology and work in laboratories with flow-through seawater to allow housing temperate marine species. Channel Islands National Park provides access to the habitats of several rare and endemic plant species suffering from the impacts of exotic weeds and feral animals. The national park also has a wealth of marine resources in need of study and management. Field station biologists analyze data collected from the park and assist with the park's extensive resource monitoring program.
Scientists at the Channel Islands Field Station conduct research on the ecology and conservation biology of sensitive plants and animals at the Channel Islands and along California's coast. In doing so, the field station supports information needs of the National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and other state and federal clients such as the Department of Defense, National Marine Sanctuary, and California Department of Fish and Game.
Some examples of ongoing research in plant ecology include rare plant demography, effects of grazing by feral animals on native plant communities, restoration ecology, and the distribution of invasive exotic weeds. Examples of research in marine ecology are restoration strategies for the nearly extirpated white abalone, patterns of disturbance for threatened western snowy plovers, marine reserve design, and kelp forest community dynamics.

Turning Of The Tide At Tonle Sap
Tonle Sap is an interesting body of fresh water. Certain times of the year, it is a lake and other times of the year it is a river. During the dry season (November-May) the water drains into the Mekong in Phnom Penh creating a river and when the monsoon season hits (June-October), the flow of water reverses back and forms a lake. The lake/river hybrid is also an important element of Cambodia because of the area’s rich diversity of ecological life and the water’s importance to the villagers in the area.
Bon Om Thong or the Khmer Water Festival is celebrated during late October or early November’s full moon when the water reverses its flow. For three days, the towns and villages along the river, including Phnom Penh bursts into life with fleets of luminously decorated boats filling Tonle Sap. Celebrations also happen in Angkor Wat, although smaller in scale it is still impressive, with the temple serving as a scenic backdrop. The highlights of the festival are the boat races that draw huge crowds from all over and are contested by hundreds of boats comprising thousands of paddlers.The festival itself has ancient roots. Angkorian kings would hold competitions and see who the greatest warriors were. You can compare this competition to a joust in Europe as a means of training and a contest under the king’s watchful eye.
Bon Om Thong also has spiritual significance. People would pray and thank the river for providing water, fertile land, and fish.
Being around Tonle Sap around this time is an excellent time to discover Cambodia and join the locals in the biggest celebration of the year.

# Change-making problem - counterexample for greedy algorithm

Let D be set of denominations and m the largest element of D. We say c is counterexample if greedy algorithm is giving answer different from optimal one.

I found statement that if for given set greedy algorithm is non-optimal, the smallest c will be smaller than 2m-1.

The question is if it's really true and how to prove it? If not, is there a relatively small range to look for the smallest counterexample?

-
How do you define the optimal solution? What objective function do you optimize? –  Yury Dec 1 '12 at 3:50
@Yury: You want to minimize the number of coins used to make up the given amound. –  Brian M. Scott Dec 1 '12 at 7:24
I think you need some assumptions, e.g. for coins $\{2- qrt{2}, 1,  qrt{2}\}$, the first natural number for which the greedy algorithm doesn't work is $3 > 2 qrt{2}$. If you are talking about coins $\in \mathbb{N}$, then I remember something similar, but I can't recollect the source. The articles mentioned by Hendrik look promising, however ,it was not there where I saw it. –  dtldarek Dec 1 '12 at 11:12

## 2 Answers

The paper "Optimal Bounds for the Change-Making Problem" (by Kozen and Zaks, TCS 1994) gives a bound of $x < c_M + c_{m-1}$ where $x$ is the counter example and $c_m$ and $c_{m-1}$ are the largest and second largest coin. They claim the bound is optimal. (I just browsed the paper, and I did not take the time to understand whether this automatically means you cannout expres it in the largest coin value)

Jeffrey Shallit (famous for his paper "What this country needs is an 18c piece") in 1998 posted a bibliography on the subject: mathforum. Shallit adds "... it is a problem in which it is notoriously easy to make wrong conclusions -- some of them have even been published".

Good luck with your investigations.

I recently came up with 1 solution that seemed to show if the given 2 conditions are satisfied, the greedy algorithm would yield the optimal solution.

a) The G.C.D (All the denominations except 1) = 2nd Smallest denomination.

b) The sum of any 2 consecutive denominations must be lesser than the 3rd consecutive denomination.

For eg. $c_2 + c_3 < c_4$.

(Where $c_1 = 1; c_2, c_3, c_4$ are coin denominations in ascending order).

I understand this is not a complete solution. However, I believe that if these 2 conditions are met, the greedy algorithm will yield the optimal solution.

Duplicate answer. As there, this would be more useful if accompanied by a proof. –  robjohn Mar 6 '13 at 9:56

The age-old question of "What makes a good leader?" is making its latest debut on the education front in New York City. With all the recent developments regarding teacher evaluations, the discussion of principal evaluations has emerged. In order to improve education, every aspect of a school must be addressed -- including the principal. Principals, like any other type of leader, have a lot of responsibilities. The main job of a principal is to ensure that the students in their school are receiving an effective education, and they must do whatever it takes to ensure that that happens -- no excuses.
What are the qualities of a great principal?
1) Providing constructive feedback to teachers
At an event hosted by teacher group Educators 4 Excellence, 64 percent of teachers in the room said that their principals do not provide meaningful feedback. This is a scary statistic. As a student, I am constantly being evaluated and given feedback -- this is how I know where my weaknesses are, and how I can improve. Teachers need the same type of support from principals.
2) Accepting feedback from teachers, administrators, and students
An effective leader must receive feedback from those they are leading -- and respect it. Being a principal should not be a solo job -- every part of the school community needs to speak up, and be heard. A principal needs to take both praise and criticism constructively. If something is going right, build on it. If something is going wrong, find out why, and fix it.
3) Being accessible and consistent
A principal needs to be available to teachers, parents, and students as often as possible. A principal can't spend all their time cooped up in an office, or outside the school building, rather a balance of in the classrooms and in an office. A principal needs to be present to ensure that what is supposed to be happening is happening, and ready to address any concerns that may arise.
4) Facilitating meaningful communication and collaboration between teachers
Communication is a fundamental concept across the board -- from personal things such as relationships to worldwide issues. A school is no exception -- the teachers and administrators must work together to improve classes, and the school as a whole. Students working together is no foreign concept. Group projects, peer tutoring, and other methods of student collaboration have existed for quite a while, and research has shown that this is beneficial for the students. Teachers can learn a lot from each other, even across the disciplines. Mr. Dimitri Saliani, principal of Eleanor Roosevelt High School, recognizes the importance of continued learning, even as an educator: "I pride myself on being a learner, not just an educator. Every teacher is a learner and has obviously enjoyed learning in their lifetime, hence their career choice, so I wondered how else we can learn from one another at ERHS." Mr. Saliani implemented a system that allowed teachers from all disciplines to attend his classroom visits with him -- regardless of the subject. I saw math teachers in my history class, history teachers in my science class, and so on. He concluded by stating, "It has invigorated the faculty and myself to learn from one another, to think about employing new teaching and learning strategies, and opened the door to new opportunities for collaboration." A great principal goes beyond the simple teacher meetings, and creatively develops innovative ways for teachers to collaborate.
5) A constant effort to innovate and improve
A great principal knows that there is always room for improvement. A principal should wake up every morning and ask "How can I make my school better?" Principals need to be creative, and develop unique ways to engage the teachers and students. Principals must be willing to take risks sometimes -- a school cannot be run the same tried-and-true way forever. Evaluators: keep this in mind -- measure a principal not just using pre-established rubrics and methods -- but on creativity and innovation, two things that don't always end up on paper.
A short, numbered list doesn't cover all the qualities of an effective principal -- a principal should have years of experience to complement the qualities I highlighted. In a release by Educators 4 Excellence, Evan Stone, Co-Founder and Co-CEO states, "As school leaders, principals play a key role in evaluating and supporting teachers and we need to make sure that they get fair and useful feedback that will ultimately benefit teachers and students." The bottom line is that in a school, everyone has a job to do, and everyone needs useful feedback in order to create the best learning environment possible. Principals are no exception.
Everybody, speak up! Share your thoughts on what makes a great principal, and how principals should be evaluated.

# Finding the limit of $\frac{1}{t qrt{1+t}} - \frac{1}{t}$ as $t$ tends to $0$

$$\lim_{t\rightarrow 0}\left(\frac{1}{t qrt{1+t}} - \frac{1}{t}\right)$$

I attemped to combine the two fraction and multiply by the conjugate and I ended up with:

$$\frac{t^2-t^2 qrt{1+t}}{t^3+{t qrt{1+t}({t qrt1+t})}}$$

I couldn't really work it out in my head on what to do with the last term $t qrt{1+t}({t qrt{1+t}})$ so I left it like that because I think it works anyways. Everything is mathematically correct up to this point but does not give the answer the book wants yet. What did I do wrong?

As $x$ approaches $0$ ?? $x=t$, eh? –  GEdgar Jan 18 '12 at 1:16
Something has gone wrong with your algebra. Can you list out the steps you took in more detail? –  Joe Johnson 126 Jan 18 '12 at 1:22

Perhaps you were trying something like

$\dfrac{1}{t qrt{1+t}} - \dfrac{1}{t} = \dfrac{1- qrt{1+t}}{t qrt{1+t}} = \dfrac{1-(1+t)}{t qrt{1+t}(1+ qrt{1+t})} = \dfrac{-1}{ qrt{1+t}(1+ qrt{1+t})}$

which has a limit of $\dfrac{-1}{1 \times (1+1)} = -\dfrac{1}{2}$ as $t$ tends to $0$.

Added: If you are unhappy with the first step, try instead $\dfrac{1}{t qrt{1+t}} - \dfrac{1}{t} = \dfrac{t-t qrt{1+t}}{t^2 qrt{1+t}} = \dfrac{t^2-t^2(1+t)}{t^3 qrt{1+t}(1+ qrt{1+t})} = \dfrac{-t^3}{t^3 qrt{1+t}(1+ qrt{1+t})}$ $= \dfrac{-1}{ qrt{1+t}(1+ qrt{1+t})}$ to get the same result

I think you did that wrong, for the fractions to be combined you have to multiply them by each others denominators. –  user138246 Jan 18 '12 at 1:16
@Jordan: The common denominator is $t qrt{1+t}$. You can do it, as you say, to get $t^2 qrt{1+t}$. You'll just have an extra factor of $t$ in the numerator. –  Joe Johnson 126 Jan 18 '12 at 1:20
@Jordan Henry used a least common denominator:$${1\over t qrt{1+t}}-{1\over t}={1\over t qrt{1+t}}-{ qrt{1+t}\over t qrt{1+t} } = { 1- qrt{1+t}\over t qrt{1+t}}$$ –  David Mitra Jan 18 '12 at 1:21
I am not really following what is happening or how that is a valid operation. The rule I have always heard is that you have to multiply be both the denominators or a lcd which is logical to me. If I have 1/2 + 1/4 I can make it 2/4 + 1/4 which works out. –  user138246 Jan 18 '12 at 1:24
@Jordan you can multiply by what is necessary to get both denominators the same. e.g., $${1\over 2}+{1\over4}={2\cdot1\over2\cdot 2}+{1\over4 }$$ or $${3\over 6}+ {1\over 15}= {5\cdot 3\over5\cdot6}+{2\cdot1\over 2\cdot15}$$ –  David Mitra Jan 18 '12 at 1:35

Asymptotics:

\begin{align} \frac{1}{ qrt{1+t}} &= (1+t)^{-1/2} = 1 - \frac{1}{2}\;t + o(t) \\ \frac{1}{t qrt{1+t}} &= \frac{1}{t} - \frac{1}{2} + o(1) \\ \frac{1}{t qrt{1+t}} - \frac{1}{t} &= - \frac{1}{2} + o(1) . \end{align}

-
I don't know what that word means or what happened at all here. –  user138246 Jan 18 '12 at 1:24
The Binomial Theorem says that $(1+t)^{-1/2}=1-\frac12t+o(t)$ where $o$ is little-o. The rest is division and subtraction. –  robjohn Jan 18 '12 at 1:46
+1, Been waiting for limit problems to be squashed just like this for a long time, finally the wait is over! –  Arjang Jan 18 '12 at 2:06
@Jordan: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_analysis. If you don't know, then ask! –  JavaMan Jan 18 '12 at 4:11
The signs $ im$ should be $=$. –  Did Jan 18 '12 at 6:42

I'd use a substitution to get rid of the surd.

$$\mathop {\lim }\limits_{t \to 0} -\frac{1}{t}\left( {1 - \frac{1}{{ qrt {t + 1} }}} \right) =$$

$$ qrt {t + 1} = u$$

$$\mathop {\lim }\limits_{u \to 1} -\frac{1}{{{u^2} - 1}}\left( {1 - \frac{1}{u}} \right) =$$

$$\mathop {\lim }\limits_{u \to 1} -\frac{1}{{{u^2} - 1}}\left( {\frac{{u - 1}}{u}} \right) =$$

$$\mathop {\lim }\limits_{u \to 1} -\frac{1}{{u + 1}}\left( {\frac{1}{u}} \right) = -\frac{1}{2}$$

-

You could also use L'Hopitals rule:

First note that

$\frac{1}{t qrt{1+t}} - \frac{1}{t} = \frac{1- qrt{1+t}}{t qrt{1+t}}$

L'Hopitals rule is that if: $f(x)=0$ and $g(x)=0$ then

$\lim_{t\to x} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$

with some provisos that I'll ignore here...

In our case

• $f(t) = 1 -  qrt{1+t}$

So $f'(t) = (-1/2)(1+t)^{-1/2}$ and $f'(0)=-1/2$.

• $g(t) = t qrt{1+t}$

So $g'(t) =  qrt{1+t} + (t/2)(1+t)^{-1/2}$ and $g'(0)=1$

So finally we get $f'(0)/g'(0) = -1/2$ as the limit we need.

-
If the OP knew derivatives, then one could simply interpret the original limit as $f'(0)$, where $f$ is the function $f(t) = \frac{1}{ qrt{1+t}}-1$. –  JavaMan Jan 18 '12 at 5:27

Let $f:]0,\infty[\to\mathbb{R}$ given by $$f(x)=\frac{1}{ qrt{x}}.$$ Then $$\frac{1}{t qrt{1+t}} - \frac{1}{t}=\frac{f(1+t)-f(1)}{t},$$ so $$\lim_{t\to 0} \frac{1}{t qrt{1+t}} - \frac{1}{t}=\lim_{t\to 0} \frac{f(1+t)-f(1)}{t}=f'(1).$$ Since $$f'(x)=-\dfrac{1}{2}\cdot x^{-\frac{3}{2}}$$ in $]0,\infty[,$ we get $$\lim_{t\to 0} \frac{1}{t qrt{1+t}} - \frac{1}{t}=\left. -\dfrac{1}{2}\cdot t^{-\frac{3}{2}}\right|_1=-\frac{1}{2}.$$

This book is an English translation of Kiyosi Itô's monograph published in Japanese in 1957. It gives a unified and comprehensive account of additive processes (or Lévy processes), stationary processes, and Markov processes, which constitute the three most important classes of stochastic processes. Written by one of the leading experts in the field, this volume presents to the reader lucid explanations of the fundamental concepts and basic results in each of these three major areas of the theory of stochastic processes.

With the requirements limited to an introductory graduate course on analysis (especially measure theory) and basic probability theory, this book is an excellent text for any graduate course on stochastic processes.

Kiyosi Itô is famous throughout the world for his work on stochastic integrals (including the Itô formula), but he has made substantial contributions to other areas of probability theory as well, such as additive processes, stationary processes, and Markov processes (especially diffusion processes), which are topics covered in this book. For his contributions and achievements, he has received, among others, the Wolf Prize, the Japan Academy Prize, and the Kyoto Prize.

Graduate students and research mathematicians interested in stochastic processes.

Divers have found 30 bottles of champagne thought to pre-date the French Revolution on the Baltic seabed.
When they opened one, they found the wine - believed to have been made by Clicquot (now Veuve Clicquot) between 1782 and 1788 - was still in good condition.
The bottle - whose shape indicates it was produced in the 18th Century - has now been sent to France for analysis.
If confirmed, it would be the oldest drinkable champagne in the world.
Diver Christian Ekstrom was exploring a shipwreck on the Baltic seabed when he found the bottles.
He took one to the surface, where he opened it and tasted it with his colleagues.
"It was fantastic," he told the Reuters news agency.
"It had a very sweet taste, you could taste oak and it had a very strong tobacco smell. And there were very small bubbles."
According to records, Clicquot champagne was first produced in 1772 but was laid down for 10 years.
Production was disrupted after the French Revolution in 1789.
The wine found on the seabed was perfectly preserved because of the conditions of dark and cold on the seabed.
If the bottles do come from the 1780s, that would make them around 40 years older than the current record-holder, a bottle of Perrier-Jouet from 1825.
Wine experts estimate each bottle would fetch around 500,000 Swedish kronor (£45,000; $69,000) at auction.
The bottles were found off the coast of Aaland, an autonomous part of Finland. The local authorities will decide what is done with the shipwreck - and the champagne.

Irish Druids And Old Irish
EARLY RELIGIONS OF THE
One of the most philosophical
statements from Max Müller is to this effect:
"Whatever we know of early religion, we always see that it presupposes vast
periods of an earlier development." This is exhibited in the history of all
peoples that have progressed in civilization, though we may have to travel far
back on the track of history to notice transformations of thought or belief.
When the late Dr. Birch told us that a pyramid, several hundreds of years older
than the Great Pyramid, contained the name of Osiris, we knew that at
least the Osirian part of Egyptian mythology was honoured some six or seven
thousand years ago What the earlier development of religion there was, or how
the conception of a dying and risen Osiris arose, at so remote a period, may
well excite our wonder.
Professor Jebb writes--"There was a time when they (early man)
began to speak of the natural powers as persons, and yet had not forgotten that
they were really natural, powers, and that the persons' names were merely signs?
Yet this goes on the assumption that religion--or rather dogmas thereof--sprang
from reflections upon natural phenomena. In this way, the French author of Sirius
satisfied himself, particularly on philological grounds, that the idea, of God
sprang from an association with thunder and the barking of a dog.
We are assured by Max Müller, that religion is a word that has changed from
century to century, and that "the word rose to the surface thousands of
years ago." Taking religion to imply an inward feeling of reverence
toward the unseen, and a desire to act in obedience to the inward law of right,
religion has existed as long as humanity itself. What is commonly assumed by the
word religion, by writers in general, is dogma or belief.
The importance of this subject was well put forth by the great Sanscrit
scholar in the phrase, "The real history of man is the history of
religion." This conviction lends interest and weight to any investigations
into the ancient religion of Ireland; though Plowden held that" few
histories are so charged with fables as the annals of Ireland."
It was Herder who finely said, "Our earth owes the seeds of all higher
culture to a religious tradition, whether literary or oral." In proportion
as the so-called supernatural gained an ascendancy, so was man really advancing
from the materialism and brutishness of savagedom. Lecky notes "the
disposition of man in certain stages of society towards the miraculous."
But was Buckle quite correct in maintaining that "all nature conspired to
increase the authority of the imaginative faculties, and weaken the authority of
the reasoning ones"?
It is not to be forgotten in our inquiry that, as faiths rose in the East,
science has exerted its force in the West.
Fetishism can hardly be regarded as the origin of religion. As to those
writers who see in the former the deification of natural objects, Max Müller
remarks, "They might as well speak of primitive men mummifying their dead
bodies Before they had wax to embalm them with."
Myth has been styled the basis of religion not less than of history; but how
was it begotten?
Butler, in English, Irish, and Scottish Churches, writes--
"To separate the fabulous from the probable, and the probable from the
true, will require no ordinary share of penetration and persevering
industry." We have certainly to remember, as one has said, that
"mythic history, mythic theology, mythic science, are alike records, not of
facts, but beliefs." Andrew Lang properly calls our attention to language,
as embodying thought,, being so liable to misconception and misinterpretation.
Names, connected with myths, have been so variously read and explained by
scholars, that outsiders may well be puzzled.
How rapidly a myth grows, and is greedily accepted, because of the wish it
may be true, is exemplified in the pretty story, immortalized by music, of
Jessie of Lucknow, who, in the siege, heard her deliverers, in the remote
distance, playing "The Campbells are coming." There never was,
however, a Jessie Brown there at that time; and, as one adds, Jessie has herself
"been sent to join William Tell and the other dethroned gods and
In the Hibbert Lectures, Professor Rhys observes, "The Greek
myth, which distressed the thoughtful and pious minds, like that of Socrates,
was a survival, like the other scandalous tales about the gods, from the time
when the ancestors of the Greeks were savages." May it not rather have been
derived by Homer, through the trading Phœnicians, from the older mythologies of
India and Egypt, with altered names and scenes to suit the poet's day and clime?
It would scarcely do to say with Thierry, "In legend alone rests real
history--for legend is living tradition, and three times out of four it is truer
than what we call History." According to Froude, "Legends grew as
nursery tales grow now.--There is reason to believe that religious theogonies
and heroic tales of every nation that has left a record of itself, are but
practical accounts of the first impressions produced upon mankind by the phenomena of day and night, morning
and evening, winter and summer."
Such may be a partial explanation; but it may be also assumed that they were
placed on record by the scientific holders of esoteric wisdom, as problems or
studies for elucidation by disciples.
The anthropological works of Sir John Lubbock and Dr. Tylor can be consulted
with profit upon this subject of primitive religious thought.
Hayes O'Grady brings us back to Ireland, saying, "Who shall thoroughly
discern the truth from the fiction with which it is everywhere entwined, and in
many places altogether overlaid?--There was at one time a vast amount of zeal,
ingenuity, and research expended on the elucidation and confirming of these
fables; which, if properly applied, would have done Irish history and
archaeology good service, instead of making their very names synonymous among
strangers with fancy and delusion."
After this we can proceed with the Irish legends and myths, the introduction
to this inquiry being a direction to the current superstitions of the race.

## Uniform estimates for a variational problem with small parameters.(English)Zbl 0793.49019

The author studies the constrained variational problem, $$\inf\{J_ I[u]: u\in H_ 2(I), \langle u\rangle_ I= a\}$$, where $$I$$ is a bounded interval on the line and $J_ I[u]= {1\over | I|} \int_ I (u''{}^ 2- \mu u'{}^ 2+ \psi(u))dt\quad\text{and}\quad \langle u\rangle_ I= {1\over | I|} \int_ I u dt.$ Here $$\mu$$ is a positive number and $$\psi$$ is a double well potential, e.g. $$\psi(u)=(u^ 2- 1)^ 2$$. This problem (which we denote by $$(P^ a_ I)$$) was introduced in B. D. Coleman, M. Marcus and V. J. Mizel [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 117, No. 4, 321-347 (1992)] as a model for the determination of the thermodynamical equilibrium states of unidimensional bodies. In the above-mentioned paper the authors were interested in studying the patterns of equilibrium states of large bodies. For this purpose they investigated a version of the above model in which the underlying domain is the whole line. In this version one defines $$J_ R[u]$$ (the energy of a state $$u\in H^{\text{loc}}_ 2(R)$$) as $$\liminf_{T\to\infty} J_{(-T,T)}[u]$$ and the average mass $$\langle u\rangle_ R$$ as the limit of $$\langle u\rangle_{(-T,T)}$$ (which is assumed to exist). In the present paper the author investigates the relation between the formally limiting problem $$(P^ a_ R)$$ and the problems $$(P^ a_ I)$$ as $$| I|\to\infty$$. The main part of the paper is devoted to the derivation of uniform a priori estimates for equilibrium states of problem $$(P^ a_ I)$$, which are crucial to this investigation.

The Hunt for Falling Leaves...
Nature's Color on the Ground
by Mary Catherine Ball
Being a reporter, I am always looking for an adventure. Last week, I found one.
I left work to go on a simple journey, but it turned out to be much more.
First, I crossed a mud-ridden stream. Then, I came face to face with flying creatures, fighting to get near me. I even endured webmakers spinning my hair into a shiny maze.
Where did I go? Into the woods, of course. Why? I wanted to gather some fallen leaves.
My luck was good that day. I was able to spy lots of different kinds of leaves lying on the ground. Some were leaves I had never seen. Some were still green, while others were changing to their autumn colors.
Have you ever hunted for leaves? I wonder if you know the names of five of the trees that live in your neighborhood? I bet the answer is no.
Well, me neither. So I had five of the leaves analyzed. I had found the leaves from an oak, a beech, a sweet gum tree and more.
Now, I invite you to make this journey.
Narrow body with pointy edges
Narrow body with pointy edges

Multipart 3mf file, need to extract one of those parts for printing.
I have a 3mf file that has 24 parts in it.  I want to extract one of those parts for printing.  I have Solid Works, Magics, and NetFabb.  

welcome to 3d printing, could you tell us where is your problem exactly?

If your 3D file has separate objects and vertices and are just merged together then do the following:

Import into Magics;
Select part (in the part list menu).
Right click (in the part list menu) and select Shell to parts;
(Be very careful here) Select the area you want to isolate with the translate tool. If you don't know how to do this just left click hold and drag the mouse to select an area inside a box;
Use translate tool to move it a little ahead from the original grouped object (just drag on any axis);
Right click (in the part list menu) and select merge part.

Should work out fine. Tell me if you get stuck.
This can also be done on Netfabb. Not on SolidWorks.

Vote early, Vote often
A big shout out to all of us for a successful graduation into private beta. 
Let's make it a success now, and make sure we graduate into a full-fledged site. 
So, this is one post which every user of a private beta site should read and act accordingly.
This is a reproduction of a moderator's (Richard) post on meta.hermeneutics.SE; I believe it is very much applicable to this community as well. Richard wrote a post encouraging voting. I think this is a big issue because rep is the basis of our "economy", encourages (good) user activity, sorts out our content and makes the site look active. In particular Question Votes make the site look more active.

I cannot state this strongly enough.  Voting is absolutely critical to the formation of a healthy SE site.  And this is never more true than in Private and early Public beta.  
Vote on Questions
Voting allows the community to determine what topics are allowed and what are not.  Voting shows what constitutes a well-formed question and what is unacceptable for this community.
If you need help formulating better questions, the blog post Asking Better Questions might help you out.  (Admittedly, it's geared towards the Stackoverflow crowd, but the philosophies there will help).  Also, How to Ask directly from StackOverflow is an excellent resource.
Finally, I want to reiterate that Voting on questions  is free!  It doesn't cost you any reputation to to vote a question down.  (Compared to answers:)
Vote on Answers
Voting on answers allows a dramatic increase in reputation.  Like questions, it shows that you believe and support the answer provided.  Also, vote answers up that you think are well worded and support the answer given.  
You don't have to agree with an answer to vote it up!
To show that this is true, they've even created a badge for voting up competing answers (called "Sportsmanship").
If you think an answer is useful, vote it up.  If you think an answer is not useful, vote it down.  Either way, vote!
If you need help on writing answers, the meta post How do I write a good answer to a question? will help you out.
Final thoughts
If people do not vote, there won't be enough reputation on this site for it to be promoted.  Reputation is very important to a StackExchange site as it creates the groups of people capable of maintaining the site.
To show how critical it is, Jeff Atwood posted a blog article regarding this topic: Vote Early, Vote Often
Encourage others to vote!
Quoting RobertCartaino from chat:

Vote, vote, vote. Encourage others to vote, vote, vote. On good content, leave signposts ("If you like this, please vote it up. It's important for the community!")-- in both meta and the main site. Maybe a few meta posts informing the users of the important of that type of participation. You are empowered a lot more than you know.


Don't upvote bad content (edit/suggest how to fix it instead) but make sure you remember to vote, especially for questions; if you learned something from an answer on a question, the question's probably worth an upvote too so others can find the good information.
             []

Yes. Yes. Yes. Yippie!

Yes!
Absolutely. We need to reward good answers, and raise rep levels so suers can get moderation privileges when they rise to the normal public beta levels.
However, I think we should also downvote poor questions and answers. I haven't yet done so, partly because I've focused on rewarding the good posts. But downvoting is important, too.
What happened to me yesterday:

I posted an answer (my first) to a question.
It was downvoted.
A user who may/may not have been the downvoter pointed out something I was wrong about.
There was a discussion in comments.
I deleted my answer.
I edited it.
There was continued dialogue with the user and another. I improved my answer even further.
Downvote was removed.

I'm grateful to the downvoter, and to the comments. We need to establish what posts are good and bad in the site, and my original answer was not good. It was wrong in several points - and since the question was about safety, it was even more important for it to be correct. The feedback helped me to fix my answer, but if I had not done so, the downvote would have ensured that better answers went to the top.
We should definitely upvote. But downvoting is good, too. Downvoters don't have to comment - that's never the case - but comments certainly help. They helped me.

For graduation, voting is the key to get a growing community that wants to come back to post questions and answers! 
According to SE.3D Printing user stats at Area 51 we need more questions and a solid group of users to assist in moderating the site. 
The amount of questions are hard to control, but could be increased by the avid users by posting questions and answer those themselves (e.g. about problems you encountered while gaining experience in 3D printing, this is perfectly legal and documents the gained experience to be shared with others). Another aspect is the solid group of users. According to the stats page:

This implies we are short on 200+ rep users (20 people). This can be influenced by voting! There are so many questions unaccepted and a few do not have an answer, so there is a lot of reputation points to be awarded.
Please vote, not only answers, but also on questions. Please do also downvote to keep the quality high, but leave a comment why you downvote, when this answer/question is then modified to address your concerns please revisit to review your vote again.

+1 Don't forget to mention that on fully graduated sites, we need users with >10k who can access the moderation tools and users >3K who can vote fully (close votes for example). See this answer to the question “Graduation” of this Community

The sub 200 rep users are the hardest to retain on the site. Often they come along with poorly written questions, get a quick answer and don't come back. Encouraging them to engage a bit more with the site is really hard.

There are other considerations, as have already been noted on What does it take to get out of Beta stage?
On fully graduated sites, we need:

users with > 10k who can access the moderation tools and;
users > 3k who can vote fully (close votes for example). 


For a full list of reputation against privileges on a fully graduated site, take a look at the Raspberry Pi privileges page:



As can be seen, the reputation differs greatly from the reputation required when the site is in beta, see our privileges.




See this answer to the question “Graduation” of this Community for SE.Robotics.Meta, in particular this very poignant paragraph:

Also, consider this, we don't have a single 10k user right now. If we were to graduate today, the only people who would have access to moderator tools would be ♦ moderators. The problems are even worse further down the reputation scale, we only have 6 users with 3k or more reputation, who aren't already ♦ moderators, so only these 6 people would be able to cast ordinary close votes.

Our case is very similar. We have (click here):

One user who is near 10k, and that is, without wishing to name and shame (;-D) Tom
6 users over 3k


We all get the ability to vote up to 40 Q/A's per day ... that's a potential of 400 points of reputation value. It's free to us, so we should be using them. Currently I've been on the site for 30 days and I have the 16th highest voting total out of everybody! That's kinda sad, isn't it? As the title of this Meta post reads, Vote Early; Vote Often!

Yeah, I had noticed how well you were doing. Keep it up! :-)

Anthony Marr from the HOPE Foundation’s main point was the wild tigers. He believes that something must be done to keep these animals alive. "If we let this go, life will be less beautiful and worth less living," Anthony Marr quoted. The money that he receives as a conservationist is donated to help out the endangered species. He makes many trips to India to help them find other solutions to their problems. If the people living in India keep living the way they’ve done, India will soon become a desert. Changes need to be made and people need to adapt to these changes.
I agree with Anthony’s beliefs. Even if tigers are bred, it does not make
a difference, because they cannot survive on their own. No matter what
humans do, it still will not change the fact that one of God’s creations
is becoming destroyed. No animals should be killed for the purpose of
human needs. It is not necessary to kill tigers to sell products and make
money because of silly beliefs that of they eat this then something will
happen. There are so many alternatives. Humans need food, but they do not
have to consume so much meat. Every time they eat meat, a precious animal
is being killed. Animals do not kill us and eat us, then why should we do
the same? More solutions need to be found and more people need to become
more involved in saving the beauty of the world.

Fast Food Tied to Asthma, Eczema and Hay Fever in Kids
MONDAY, Jan. 14 (HealthDay News) -- Kids who eat fast food three or more times a week are likely to have more severe allergic reactions, a large new international study suggests.
These include bouts of asthma, eczema and hay fever (rhinitis). And although the study doesn't prove that those burgers, chicken snacks and fries cause these problems, the evidence of an association is compelling, researchers say.
"The study adds to a growing body of evidence of the possible harms of fast foods," said study co-author Hywel Williams, a professor of dermato-epidemiology at the University of Nottingham, in England.
"Whether the evidence we have found is strong enough to recommend a reduction of fast food intake for those with allergies is a matter of debate," he added.
These finding are important, Williams said, because this is the largest study to date on allergies in young people across the world and the findings are remarkably consistent globally for both boys and girls and regardless of family income.
"If true, the findings have big public health implications given that these allergic disorders appear to be on the increase and because fast food is so popular," he said.
However, Williams cautioned that fast food might not be causing these problems. "It could be due to other factors linked to behavior that we have not measured, or it could be due to biases that occur in studies that measure disease and ask about previous food intake," he said.
In addition, this association between fast foods and severe allergies does not necessarily mean that eating less fast food will reduce the severity of disease of asthma, hay fever or eczema (an itchy skin disorder), Williams said.
The report was published in the Jan. 14 online issue of Thorax.
Williams and colleagues collected data on more than 319,000 teens aged 13 and 14 from 51 countries and more than 181,000 kids aged 6 and 7 from 31 countries. All of the children were part of a single study on child asthma and allergies.
Kids and their parents were asked about whether they suffered from asthma or runny or blocked nose along with itchy and watery eyes and eczema. Participants also described in detail what they ate during the week.
Fast food was linked to those conditions in both older and younger children.
Consuming three or more weekly fast food meals was associated with a 39 percent increased risk of severe asthma among teens And three such meals for younger children was associated with a 27 percent increased risk of severe asthma, as well higher risk of rhinitis and eczema.
Fruit, however, appeared to reduce the incidence and severity of these conditions for all the children, and for incidence and severity of wheeze and rhinitis among the teens.
According to Williams, three or more weekly servings of fruit reduced the severity of symptoms 11 percent among the teens and 14 percent among the children.
When looked at closely, the data among children was not as convincing as among teens. However, fast food meals were still associated with symptoms except for current eczema, and in poorer countries, except for current and severe asthma.
"Eating fast food is not healthy for a multitude of reasons," said Samantha Heller, an exercise physiologist and clinical nutrition coordinator at the Center for Cancer Care at Griffin Hospital in Derby, Conn.
It's notorious for being high in sodium, saturated fat, trans fats and refined and processed carbohydrates, and low in essential healthy nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, healthy unsaturated fats and fiber, she said.
"I cannot imagine any parent would choose the convenience of fast food over their child's health if they fully understood how deleterious a diet of fast and junk food is to children," Heller added.
Healthy compounds like vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and healthy fats are essential players in whole-body immunity. Kids eating fast food regularly are subject not only to the disease-promoting and inflammatory effects of trans and saturated fats, excess sodium and refined carbohydrates but also likely to suffer from deficiencies of essential health-promoting compounds, Heller said.
"This can lead to chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, behavior problems, and as this study suggests, possibly asthma, eczema and colds," she said.
Eating at home more often not only saves money but also keeps families healthier, Heller said.
"For example, you can make healthy fast-food dishes in your own kitchen, such as black bean veggie burgers on whole-wheat buns with tomato and avocado, mashed potatoes with low-fat milk and olive oil or roasted sweet potato fries," she suggested.

The Union War
By Gary W. Gallagher
Harvard University Press. $27.95
New York Times Book Review, May 1, 2011
Among the enduring mysteries of the American Civil War is why millions of Northerners were willing to fight to preserve the nation's unity. It is not difficult to understand why the Southern states seceded in 1860 and 1861. As the Confederacy's founders explained ad infinitum, they feared that Abraham Lincoln's election as president placed the future of slavery in jeopardy. But why did so few Northerners echo the refrain of Horace Greeley, the editor of The New York Tribune: "Erring sisters, go in peace"?
The latest effort to explain this deep commitment to the nation's survival comes from Gary W. Gallagher, the author of several highly regarded works on Civil War military history. In "The Union War," Gallagher offers not so much a history of wartime patriotism as a series of meditations on the meaning of the Union to Northerners, the role of slavery in the conflict and how historians have interpreted (and in his view misinterpreted) these matters.
The Civil War, Gallagher announces at the outset, was "a war for Union that also killed slavery." Emancipation was an outcome (an "astounding" outcome, Lincoln remarked in his second Inaugural Address) but, Gallagher insists, it always "took a back seat" to the paramount goal of saving the Union. Most Northerners, he says, remained indifferent to the plight of the slaves. They embraced emancipation only when they concluded it had become necessary to win the war. They fought because they regarded the United States as a unique experiment in democracy that guaranteed political liberty and economic opportunity in a world overrun by tyranny. Saving the Union, in the words of Secretary of State William H. Seward, meant "the saving of popular government for the world."
At a time when only half the population bothers to vote and many Americans hold their elected representatives in contempt, Gallagher offers a salutary reminder of the power of democratic ideals not simply to Northerners in the era of the Civil War, but also to people in other nations, who celebrated the Union victory as a harbinger of greater rights for themselves. Imaginatively invoking sources neglected by other scholars — wartime songs, patriotic images on mailing envelopes and in illustrated publications, and regimental histories written during and immediately after the conflict — Gallagher gives a dramatic portrait of the power of wartime nationalism.
His emphasis on the preservation of democratic government and the opportunities of free labor as central to the patriotic outlook is hardly new — one need only read Lincoln's wartime speeches to find eloquent expression of these themes. But instead of celebrating the greatness of American democracy, Gallagher claims, too many historians dwell on its limitations, notably the exclusion from participation of nonwhites and women. Moreover, perhaps because of recent abuses of American power in the name of freedom, scholars seem uncomfortable with robust expressions of patriotic sentiment, especially when wedded to military might. According to Gallagher, they denigrate nationalism and suggest that the war had no real justification other than the abolition of slavery. (Gallagher ignores a different interpretation of the Union war effort, emanating from neo-Confederates and the libertarian right, which portrays Lincoln as a tyrant who presided over the destruction of American freedom through creation of the leviathan national state, not to mention the dreaded income tax.)
Gallagher devotes many pages — too many in a book of modest length — to critiques of recent Civil War scholars, whom he accuses of exaggerating the importance of slavery in the conflict and the contribution of black soldiers to Union victory. Often, his complaint seems to be that another historian did not write the book he would have written.
Thus, Gallagher criticizes Melinda Lawson, the author of "Patriot Fires," one of the most influential recent studies of wartime nationalism, for slighting the experiences of the soldiers. But Lawson was examining nation-building on the Northern home front. Her investigation of subjects as diverse as the marketing of war bonds, the dissemination of pro-Union propaganda and the organization of Sanitary Fairs, where goods were sold to raise money for soldiers' aid, illuminates how the nation state for the first time reached into the homes and daily lives of ordinary Americans.
Gallagher also criticizes recent studies of soldiers' letters and diaries, which find that an antislavery purpose emerged early in the war. These works, he argues, remain highly "impressionistic," allowing the historian "to marshal support for virtually any argument." Whereupon Gallagher embarks on his own equally impressionistic survey of these letters, finding that they emphasize devotion to the Union.
Ultimately, Gallagher's sharp dichotomy between the goals of Union and emancipation seems excessively schematic. It begs the question of what kind of Union the war was being fought to preserve. The evolution of Lincoln's own outlook illustrates the problem. On the one hand, as Gallagher notes, Lincoln always insisted that he devised his policies regarding slavery in order to win the war and preserve national unity. Yet years before the Civil War, Lincoln had argued that slavery fatally undermined the nation's ability to exemplify the superiority of free institutions. The Union to be saved, he said, must be "worthy of the saving." During the secession crisis, Lincoln could have preserved the Union by yielding to Southern demands. He adamantly refused to compromise on the crucial political issue — whether slavery should be allowed to expand into Western territories.
Gallagher maintains that only failure on the battlefield, notably Gen. George B. McClellan's inability to capture Richmond, the Confederate capital, in the spring of 1862, forced the administration to act against slavery. Yet the previous fall, before significant military encounters had taken place, Lincoln had already announced a plan for gradual emancipation. This hardly suggests that military necessity alone placed the slavery question on the national agenda. Early in the conflict, many Northerners, Lincoln included, realized that there was little point in fighting to restore a status quo that had produced war in the first place.
Many scholars have argued that the war brought into being a new conception of American nationhood. Gallagher argues, by contrast, that it solidified pre--existing patriotic values. Continuity, not change, marked Northern attitudes. Gallagher acknowledges that as the war progressed, "a struggle for a different kind of Union emerged." Yet his theme of continuity seems inadequate to encompass the vast changes Americans experienced during the Civil War. Surely, he is correct that racism survived the war. Yet he fails to account for the surge of egalitarian sentiment that inspired the rewriting of the laws and Constitution to create, for the first time, a national citizenship enjoying equal rights not limited by race.
Before the war, slavery powerfully affected the concept of self-government. Large numbers of Americans identified democratic citizenship as a privilege of whites alone — a position embraced by the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott decision of 1857. Which is why the transformation wrought by the Civil War was so remarkable. As George William Curtis, the editor of Harper's Weekly, observed in 1865, the war transformed a government "for white men" into one "for mankind." That was something worth fighting for.

# Relation between independent increments and Markov property

Independent increments and Markov property.do not imply each other. I was wondering

• if being one makes a process closer to being the other?
• if there are cases where one implies the other?

Thanks and regards!

-

To see this, assume that $(X_n)_{n\ge0}$ has independent increments, that is, $X_0=0$ and $X_n=Y_1+\cdots+Y_n$ for every $n\ge1$, where $(Y_n)_{n\ge1}$ is a sequence of independent random variables. The filtration of $(X_n)_{n\ge0}$ is $(\mathcal{F}^X_n)_{n\ge0}$ with $\mathcal{F}^X_n= igma(X_k;0\le k\le n)$. Note that $$\mathcal{F}^X_n= igma(Y_k;1\le k\le n),$$ hence $X_{n+1}=X_n+Y_{n+1}$ where $X_n$ is $\mathcal{F}^X_n$ measurable and $Y_{n+1}$ is independent on $\mathcal{F}^X_n$. This shows that the conditional distribution of $X_{n+1}$ conditionally on $\mathcal{F}^X_n$ is $$\mathbb{P}(X_{n+1}\in\mathrm{d}y|\mathcal{F}^X_n)=Q_n(X_n,\mathrm{d}y), \quad \mbox{where}\quad Q_n(x,\mathrm{d}y)=\mathbb{P}(x+Y_{n+1}\in\mathrm{d}y).$$ Hence $(X_n)_{n\ge0}$ is a Markov chain with transition kernels $(Q_n)_{n\ge0}$.
@Didier: Thanks! But I think it doesn't because of the following. First $P(X(t_3) | X(t_2), X(t_1)) = P(X(t_3)-X(t_2)|X(t_2), X(t_2)-X(t_1))$. Next $P(X(t_3)-X(t_2)|X(t_2), X(t_2)-X(t_1)) = P(X(t_3)-X(t_2)|X(t_2))$, if and only if $X(t_3)-X(t_2)$ and $X(t_2)-X(t_1))$ are conditionally independent given $X(t_2)$, which can not be implied by $X(t_3)-X(t_2)$ and $X(t_2)-X(t_1))$ are independent. Any mistake? – Tim Apr 29 '11 at 20:54
What is $P(W|U,V)$ for three random variables $U$, $V$, $W$? – Did Apr 29 '11 at 22:43
Why should "independent increments" require that $Y_j$ are independent of $X_0$? $X_0$ is not an increment. – Robert Israel Apr 29 '11 at 23:08
@Didier: Thanks! 1) I still have no clue how to explain and correct (2) in my last comment. Would you point me where in what texts/materials? 2) Generally when saying increments of a stochastic process, is $X_0$ an increment? Does the definition of an independent-increment process require $X_0=0$? – Tim May 3 '11 at 12:29
Invoking "smartness" here is a way to avoid following the explicit suggestions I made, which would lead you to understand the problem. It is also a cheap shot at my advice, considering the time and work I spent on your questions. // Since once again you are stopped by matters of definitions I suggest to come back to definitions: consider random variables $\xi$ and $\eta$ and a sigma-algebra $G$ such that $\xi$ is independent on $H= igma(\eta)\vee G$. Why is $E(u(\xi+\eta)\mid H)=E(u(\xi+\eta)\mid\eta)$ for every bounded $u$? Why is this related to your question? .../... – Did Nov 6 '11 at 8:48

Robb Godshaw, from Syynlabs,
has created a haptic cube that gives you an impression of what the
temperature will be like tomorrow.
The cube, which Godshaw has named the Cryoscope, consists of an
aluminium shell surrounding a Peltier
element, heatsink, cooling fan and an LED, all controlled by an
Arduino. The cube is heated to a "neutral" state of 30C, and then
adjusted by the number of degrees that the next day's forecast
differs from room temperature (23C).
It takes into account wind chill and humidity to give an idea
what the following day will "feel" like, rather than merely
reflecting air temperature. So, for example, if the forecast for
the next day is for 18C, once those factors are all taken into
account, the cube's
temperature will decrease five degrees from 30C to 25C,
resulting in it being slightly cool to the touch.
Godshaw describes it in the video above as a "haptic
weathervane", adding: "Users enter their location into a web app.
The cube then automatically adjusts to the forecasted temperature.
By touching the Cryoscope, the user is able to feel tomorrow's air
You can see
the Cryoscope in action over on Godshaw's website.
Updated 08:29 09/05/2012: Godshaw has
redesigned the Cryoscope and is raising money for full production
over on Kickstarter.

Operating on a baby before birth may seem like science fiction, but prenatal surgery is becoming more and more common in special pediatric programs throughout the United States.
Since prenatal surgery was first pioneered in the 1980s, it's become an important way to correct certain birth defects that could be severe (and in some cases fatal) if babies were born with them unrepaired.
Prenatal surgery (also called fetal surgery or fetal intervention) most often is done to correct serious problems that can't wait to be fixed, like certain heart defects, urinary blockages, bowel obstructions, and airway malformations.
Some of the greatest successes have come from correcting spina bifida (an often disabling spinal abnormality in which the two sides of the spine fail to join together, leaving an open area). A recent landmark study reports that kids with spina bifida who received fetal surgery typically are more likely to walk, less likely to have serious neurological problems, and less likely to need a shunt to drain brain fluid.
So how does prenatal surgery work? The most common types are:
Open fetal surgery: In this type of procedure, the mother is given anesthesia, then the surgeon makes an incision in the lower abdomen to access the uterus (as would be done during a Cesarean section). The uterus is opened with a special stapling device that prevents bleeding, the fetus is either partially or completely taken out of the womb, surgery is done, then the baby is returned to the uterus, and the incision is closed. Open fetal surgery is performed for problems like spina bifida and certain other serious conditions. The mother will be in the hospital for 3-7 days and will need a C-section to give birth to the baby (and any future children).
Fetoscopic surgery: This minimally invasive type of procedure, often called Fetendo fetal surgery, is more common than open fetal surgery. Small incisions are made and the fetus is not removed from the uterus. The surgeon uses a very small telescope (called an endoscope) designed just for this kind of surgery and other special instruments to enter the uterus and correct the problem. Fetendo is most useful for problems with the placenta, such as twin-twin transfusion syndrome in which one identical twin grows at the expense of the other because of abnormal blood vessel connections in the placenta they share.
Fetal image-guided surgery: Some fetal surgery is done without an incision to the uterus or use of an endoscope. Doctors use ultrasound to guide them as they perform "fetal manipulations," such as placing a catheter in the bladder, abdomen, or chest. The least-invasive form of fetal surgery, it's not used for serious conditions that require open surgery.
The benefits of prenatal surgery don't come without risks, though. Chief among them are premature births and problems with the incision site. Moms who have fetal intervention are closely monitored for preterm labor and receive medications to control it. Still, for many parents and their babies, fetal surgery is a true medical miracle.

Hiya again guys,

I have a niggling problem with my CSM. The middle an far cascades noticeably "swim" as you move around. It's not really noticeable on the close one but i'm that's probably just due to the filtering and the factor it has such a high quality map to work from.

Anyway I have 3 cascades and i'm using a bounding box for each. They all overlap with they near clip and this works fairly nicely but I was looking at the csm sample that some nicely ported over to monogame. The problem is I can't get the sphere based bounding boxes working at all for me. My debug rendertargets for all the cascades are just blank. If I switch my camera to be the shadow light camera (the sun) it seems fine (and it works using my bounding box method so i think that's fine). I THINK i'm just calculating the bounding box (using a sphere) incorrectly some how.

public void GenerateCSMOrthoSlice(float pfarClip)
{
Vector3[] frustumCornersWS = new Vector3[8];
Vector3[] frustumCornersLS = new Vector3[8];
BoundingFrustum viewFrustum = new BoundingFrustum(_Camera.CameraView * Matrix.CreatePerspectiveFieldOfView(MathHelper.PiOver4, _Camera._aspectRatio, 10, pfarClip));
frustumCornersWS = viewFrustum.GetCorners();

Vector3 frustumCentroid = new Vector3(0, 0, 0);
for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++)
frustumCentroid += frustumCornersWS[i];
frustumCentroid /= 8;

lightsView = Matrix.Identity;
lightsViewProjectionMatrix = Matrix.Identity;

ShadowLightPos = frustumCentroid + (SunlightDirection * 100);

Vector3 mins = frustumCornersLS[0];
Vector3 maxes = frustumCornersLS[0];
for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++)
{
if (frustumCornersLS[i].X > maxes.X)
maxes.X = frustumCornersLS[i].X;
else if (frustumCornersLS[i].X < mins.X)
mins.X = frustumCornersLS[i].X;
if (frustumCornersLS[i].Y > maxes.Y)
maxes.Y = frustumCornersLS[i].Y;
else if (frustumCornersLS[i].Y < mins.Y)
mins.Y = frustumCornersLS[i].Y;
if (frustumCornersLS[i].Z > maxes.Z)
maxes.Z = frustumCornersLS[i].Z;
else if (frustumCornersLS[i].Z < mins.Z)
mins.Z = frustumCornersLS[i].Z;
}

float diagonalLength = (frustumCornersWS[0] - frustumCornersWS[6]).Length();
diagonalLength += 2;    //Without this, the shadow map isn't big enough in the world.
float worldsUnitsPerTexel = diagonalLength / (float)4096;

Vector3 vBorderOffset = (new Vector3(diagonalLength, diagonalLength, diagonalLength) - (maxes - mins)) * 0.5f;
maxes += vBorderOffset;
mins -= vBorderOffset;

mins /= worldsUnitsPerTexel;
mins.X = (float)Math.Floor(mins.X);
mins.Y = (float)Math.Floor(mins.Y);
mins.Z = (float)Math.Floor(mins.Z);
mins *= worldsUnitsPerTexel;

maxes /= worldsUnitsPerTexel;
maxes.X = (float)Math.Floor(maxes.X);
maxes.Y = (float)Math.Floor(maxes.Y);
maxes.Z = (float)Math.Floor(maxes.Z);
maxes *= worldsUnitsPerTexel;

ShadowLightProjection = Matrix.CreateOrthographicOffCenter(mins.X, maxes.X, mins.Y, maxes.Y, -maxes.Z - 500f, -mins.Z);
}

What I tried (which doesn't work at all) is:

public void GenerateCSMOrthoSlice(float pfarClip)
{

Vector3 minExtents = Vector3.Zero;
Vector3 maxExtents = Vector3.Zero;
Vector3[] frustumCornersWS = new Vector3[8];
Vector3[] frustumCornersLS = new Vector3[8];
BoundingFrustum viewFrustum = new BoundingFrustum(_Camera.CameraView * Matrix.CreatePerspectiveFieldOfView(MathHelper.PiOver4, _Camera._aspectRatio, 10, pfarClip));
frustumCornersWS = viewFrustum.GetCorners();

Vector3 frustumCentroid = new Vector3(0, 0, 0);
for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++)
frustumCentroid += frustumCornersWS[i];
frustumCentroid /= 8;

{

// This needs to be constant for it to be stable
var upDir = Vector3.Up;

// Calculate the radius of a bounding sphere surrounding the frustum corners
for (var i = 0; i < 8; ++i)
{
var dist = (_frustumCorners[i] - frustumCentroid).Length();
}

minExtents = -maxExtents;
}

lightsView = Matrix.Identity;
lightsViewProjectionMatrix = Matrix.Identity;

//Vector3 sunlightdirection = new Vector3(0.21f, 0.11f, -0.5f);
ShadowLightPos = frustumCentroid + (SunlightDirection * 100);

Vector3 mins = frustumCornersLS[0];
Vector3 maxes = frustumCornersLS[0];
for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++)
{
if (frustumCornersLS[i].X > maxes.X)
maxes.X = frustumCornersLS[i].X;
else if (frustumCornersLS[i].X < mins.X)
mins.X = frustumCornersLS[i].X;

I'm no MonoGame expert, but looking at your code it looks like you mixed up the parameters to Matrix.CreateOrthographicOffCenter() in the stabilized version.

Thanks, yes. Well spotted. Unfortunately that had no effect.

Shimmery shadows have been bugging me for ages but I can't seem to figure out how to use the sphere method of making my cascades

##### Share on other sites

If anyone could give  me some code/pseudo code for finding the bounding sphere of my shadow camera that would do. I was reading shaderx7 on this subject. Which was interedting but the math is over my head. I don't mind the wasted space. By the time my game is finished games will be able to support one giant texture lol

Thanks

Here is my code that is used in production (So I know it works ;-) )

	V4 vMin = vCorners[0];
V4 vMax = vCorners[0];
for(int j = 1; j<8; j++) {
vMin = VMin(vMin, vCorners[j]);
vMax = VMax(vMax, vCorners[j]);
}
V4 vSize = vMax - vMin;
float fRadius = VLen3(vSize).x() * 0.5f;

// Snap center to shadow texel
// This is done by transforming center of CSM frustum into light post projection (texel space) and
// perform snapping in this space.
M44 mCameraToLight = MInverseAffine(mLightToCamera);
V4 vCenterCamera = VLerp(vMin, vMax, VSplat(0.5f));
V4 vCenterLight = VTransform43(mCameraToLight, vCenterCamera);
vCenterTexel = VProject(vCenterTexel);
vSnap = VFloor(vSnap);
V4 vSnapOffset = VLoadZero() - vSnap;
mSnapTrans.vTrans = VXY01(vSnapOffset);


Hope it makes sense.

BTW: Looking at your code I think the issue is the way you apply the offset directly to the matrix instead of doing a multiplication with a translation matrix (Like I do in the last line)

Henning

Oh, and I now use the quantization trick instead of the code above to get more precision (http://dev.theomader.com/stable-csm/)

This ia  video of the problem. I'm not if i'm barking up the wrong tree. But shadows are very "jiggly" on some objects. I wanted to try the sphere based approach. Which from my understanding is making a bounding sphere from the shadow camera view frustrum then creating my usual orthographic projection for my cascade from that. Am I undestanding it correctly?

Here's a video of the annoying problem I have. Shortly into the video i turn on the rendertarget display so you can see the 3 cascade render targets on the right. As you can see theres a lot of jiggle going on. Depth Bias doesn't seem to make any difference really.

##### Share on other sites

I'm a complete noob here but i see that you rotate your shadow maps with camera orientation and this way it's impossible to avoid jittering. I think you have to keep the shadow map orientation constant in worldspace and only adapt it to the position of the camera ignoring player view direction. So when you rotate but don't move, you would see the corners of cascade transitions fixed to the floor.  Does this make sense?

I think you're probably correct/ That's what I was referring to with using a sphere from the camera frustrum to build the bounding box for my orthographic projection for the shadow like.

I think i'm missing something though. I've found some examples here and there but I'm just not getting it. Maybe some pseudo code would help me.

Semlers linked blog contains more articles and code, however...

Looking at code snippets often raises more questions than answers: What conventions are used here (is this a camera to world matrix or world to camera? what multiplication order do they use? etc. etc.) - mostly you have to care for the deatils yourself and after you undrestood the concept it's only the details that's left.

I recommend you simplyfy the problem instead so cou can solve it more easily in your own:

1. Ignore frustum and any bounds and make each cascade just centered to the texel closest to the camera. (visualizing texel grid on a simple ground plane should help to set this up. And if this works all math is known.)

2. If you get this to work robustly so the cascades move with the camera without jitter the main problem is solved and you can start to optimize it for the frustum, which shouldn't be that hard at this point.

##### Share on other sites

Thanks for the answers. That's exactly what I'm trying now Joe, ie simplifying the problem.

If I can get rid of the jiggling for 1 CSM "slice" then I'm there really. Filtering and stuff works fine already.

I'll read some more and see if I can figure out how to make my slice ignore camera rotation. I've tried moving them to texel increments (based on one of the links above CSM which i've read and reread) but the problem isn't real;y improved.

Increasing my shadow map size to something ridiculous didn't improve the jiggling either so it does seem to be the rotation causing the problem. Hence I was trying to use the sphere based approach for bounding sphere but i just don't "get it".

Or maybe I'm just doing the "move bounding box in texel increments" incorrectly..  I shall persevere.

##### Share on other sites

Ok I came back to this after working on more interesting parts of my game and although I've improved it by using a sphere based approach to making the projections it hasn't really improved the shimmering that much. In fact if i comment out my texel snapping part it makes little difference. I'm getting a bit stumped. Maybe I've been looking at it too long. It's acceptable now I guess but i'd like it to be totally rock solid ideally

This creates the projection and view for each cascade. Any ideas what i've missed?

        public void GenerateCSMOrthoSliceTS(float pNearClip, float pfarClip)
{
Vector3[] frustumCorners = new Vector3[8];

Matrix mCameraViewProj = _Camera.CameraView;
mCameraViewProj *= Matrix.CreatePerspectiveFieldOfView(MathHelper.PiOver4, _Camera._aspectRatio, pNearClip, pfarClip);
BoundingFrustum oCameraViewProjFrustum = new BoundingFrustum(mCameraViewProj);

frustumCorners = oCameraViewProjFrustum.GetCorners();

Vector3 frustumCenter = new Vector3(0, 0, 0);
for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++)
frustumCenter += frustumCorners[i];
frustumCenter /= 8;

lightsView = Matrix.Identity;
lightsViewProjectionMatrix = Matrix.Identity;

float radius = (frustumCorners[0] - frustumCorners[6]).Length() / 2.0f;

float texelsPerUnit = (float)4096 / (radius * 2.0f);
Matrix mTexelScaling = Matrix.CreateScale(texelsPerUnit);

SunlightDirection.Normalize();
Vector3 baselookAt = new Vector3(SunlightDirection.X, SunlightDirection.Y, SunlightDirection.Z);
Matrix mLookAt = Matrix.CreateLookAt(Vector3.Zero, baselookAt, Vector3.Up);
mLookAt = Matrix.Multiply(mTexelScaling, mLookAt);
Matrix mLookAtInv = Matrix.Invert(mLookAt);

frustumCenter = Vector3.Transform(frustumCenter, mLookAt);
frustumCenter.X = (float)Math.Floor(frustumCenter.X);    //clamp to texel increment
frustumCenter.Y = (float)Math.Floor(frustumCenter.Y);    //clamp to texel increment
frustumCenter = Vector3.Transform(frustumCenter, mLookAtInv);

Vector3 eye = frustumCenter + (SunlightDirection * radius * 2.0f);

Hello!
Trying to create a physics puzzle game in my "free" time.
So far it's going very steady, but slow.
Hope to get some feedback from you!

Area 86 is a physics-based game, that lets you control a robot at a secret place in space.
From simple item moving to custom imagined solutions with item picking, throwing, combining and activating!
Explore & examine all possibilities each place has to offer and do your best to get further.
But remember, each action has consequences and thus could break or make something unexpected.

Quick overlook of main features:
Physics-based gameplay with no bugs or whatsoever Tasks that give you more clue on how to do things wrong Controllable robot who can be blamed for all consequences Includes more than 1 level and each level contains less than 12 possible tasks to complete [ not in free version ] Secret places and hidden objects for extra challenge
One fully completable level with 6 tasks and 2 hidden special items to discover.
From the task list, 2 are main tasks which you should complete to get further and then there are 4 other tasks that should challenge your thinking.
One of the secret items is visible instant, but you need to figure out how to collect it, while the other special item is hiding.
Another extra feature is visual hints, that should force your thinking of discovering features.

• well, i have started developing games last year, alone , I made a singleplayer 3d openworld rpg on unity you can look at it on googleplaystore ( kooru stone rpg ) whatever, this year, i wanted to make mmo, which gone really fine until I first try real hosting, I was working on "wamp" until then. The reason i am desperate now is that the way my game works.
On my pc, using wamp mysql , with localhost as host for my game, i was testing my mmorpg with using andorid emulators, ofcourse no lag no issues no restrictions, beautiful dream... But then, I wanted to get real host from web, so, I rent a basic, cheaphest ever web host ( 10\$ year ), and transferred my php files along with sql database.
So, I launched the game, still no issues, tried to handle 2-3 players by using my pc, phone, friend's phone...
After a while, ( after really short time (3-4mins)) host started not to respond, beacause those web hosting were not fit to handle mmos, i predicted that.
now what i am explaining is that my game works like this and asking what way should i use to handle it :
- Creates web request ( like : webhost.com/game/getplayerdata.php?ID=2 )
-Reads request ( request result be like = "ID2-GoodGuyXx-23-123-4-123-43 )
-Builds player using result string
-does similar requests REEAALY FREQUENTLY  ( total requests of 8 - 12 times per seconds )
With my current ultimate cheap web hosting, i can handle 2 players with low lag ( lol ) but, i want to handle around 20-100 players,
just need a clear path, i have been struggling with google cloud sql and other vps server dedicated server options, i dont wanna pay much and get ripped off.

• Hi,

I have a triangle,oriented in a 3D Plane i.e. I have my vertices as (x1,y1,z1) ; (x2,y2,z2) and (x3,y3,z3)
I am trying to convert this triangular facet to voxelised model i.e.
Along each edge,I am applying Bresenhams 3D Line algorithm and generating intermediate points.After generating intermediate points, I want to fill the inside region.
I have been searching for some algorithm like flood filling,but did not find anything relevant till now.
I would be really glad,if some one can provide an algorithm for achieving this.
I basically have a List of tuple for storing all the (x,y,z) data created along the edges.(generated using Brsenhams 3D Line algorithm).
Now,I want an algorithm,which creates cubes in the inside region.

How to reuse modelling bases for the Stratasys uPrint SE Plus?
It's criminal how wasteful the Stratsys uPrint SE Plus is with it's 'one use' modelling bases. Is there a reliable way to re purpose them? I have tried ethanol and acetone, but not had any luck.  

Hi, when talking about "one use modelling bases", do you mean the rafts created underneath each model as it is printed?

Hello, I mean the black modelling bases that the ABS is printed onto. With this model of machine they are difficult to reuse as the support material laid down leaves a scar.

What I tried and worked is to apply water based normal Glue-stick on the tray and with few drops of water distribute it evenly across the tray surface, let it dry and then you are good to go!

Thank you for your suggestion. What sort of glue do you mean? Glue that you would use to stick paper together with?

@JPD, although I do not know the exact brand that Mohammad use, I know that UHU Glue Sticks are fairly commonly used. Different glue stick give somewhat different results, so you might want to try a few different types.

The brands I tried are Scholastic glue stick and Staples glue stick both gave the same results. Worth mentioning that it is easier to remove the part when the tray is cool.I plan to experiment with the Aquanet hairspray next week.

People have done quite a bit of experimenting with reusing Mojo build plates over the years. The uPrint is likely similar. Basically a different adhesion layer is placed on the bed that has easier release. BuildTak has been used successfully. Gluestick or hairspray such as Aquanet will work and are water soluble for easier removal post-print. 

Thanks for your answer. BuildTak looks interesting. Excuse my ignorance, but would you put a layer of this on top of the modelling base before printing? Then remove the print from it, clean it and re-use?
Also do there have to be some manual adjustments to nozzle height etc. due to the added layer?
Lastly, how do machines that require calibration points (such as the uPrint SE Plus) deal with having a non-native surface to calibrate to?

Right, you put the adhesion layer on the modeling base before printing. That allows the raft to come off easier.  If the added layer is thin enough, it won't interfere with the normal raft building process. But I'm not specifically familiar with your printer, so it may take some experimenting. Obviously this isn't supported by Stratasys, because they want to make money on consumables.

Ryan, can you let us know the source for 'people have done...' to dig a bit deeper in their experience, - temerature changes and adhesion results for example? Thanks in advance

Search for Mojo posts by vrfx and EnginWiz on the 3D Printer Tips Tricks and Reviews Google Group. They've both posted about it a few times. Can't find links from my phone though.

I've done the bit where you place the tray and part into the bath. Upon completion of dissolving, I then used a little dawn dish-soap to clean the tray, let it dry. I have access and used DI water for the hand washing (without any scrub or pad, just my hands). The trays worked fine. 
Someone else took over for a bit. I think they were trying to clean with Vinegar, and the trays have all turned white (not sure if that is from this?). So, they aren't being reused.
I've started being a bit strategic with some print jobs. I'll print in one corner, then use cutters to remove the support without damaging the tray. Then I'll print on that tray in a different corner. 

By oversight in training, the operators of one of our UPrint SE Plus printers was simply placing the tray in the bath with the printed part.  After it was in the bath, all support material was removed and they dried and reused the tray.  This process was used for months before it was discovered, and they used the same tray for many prints.  Has anyone else tried this?

How to connect filament end-to-end?
Is it possible to connect two pieces of 1.75 mm filament end to end, with no change in width? I am asking the question because I am interested in creating a multi-filament feeder to a single extruder, and I am curious about the process of changing filament while the 3-d printer extruder continues uninterrupted. My current best-guess at the optimal solution is to someone 'cut' one end of the filament and 'melt' it to the end of another filament.

You'd have to ensure that the joining portion of the two filaments do not "bloom" or increase in diameter, which would happen if unconstrained at the melting and joining time. Alignment is also critical, otherwise you have a varying diameter from one color to the next at the point of join.
There's an item on ebay which is precision drilled and has precision machined mating surfaces to ensure alignment of the filament. The filament is extended through the two components, heated (in the case of the video, with a match) and the two metal parts are pushed together. The joining of the metal parts also cuts away the excess bulge of the melted filament, ensuring correct diameter.
In the case of the above item, the joining devices have to be threaded with the filament prior to the joining process and then have to be threaded off the filament by pushing them the entire length of the filament.
This would be okay if one were joining short lengths only. Consider how much fun it isn't to have to slide these two pieces over an entire full spool of filament.
A split device which would enable one to un-latch or otherwise open a clamshell to release the filament would require much more challenging machining to achieve the necessary precision, which is probably why we don't see such a product.

There is a device which can do what fred_dot_u describes in his otherwise explanatorily good answer: the easywelder, made by I3D Inno.
It fixes the filament in a separate part so that the faces are adjoined perpendicularly and then heats the joint electrically with a device that at first sight reminds me of a hair straightening iron.
I am not sure about the joint quality this machine produces, but I am skeptical whether the it is good enough for high accuracy 3d printing. Especially if you take the history of the device into account (he wanted to create a custom O-ring from Ninjaflex), which the inventor shortly describes on this instructable: http://www.instructables.com/id/Welding-tool-for-plastic-filaments

Here is a neat method I came up with:
- cut both ends diagonally
- insert them in a piece of heat-shrink tubing, making sure the diagonal cuts overlap
- protect everything but the overlap with Kapton tape
- heat the overlap with a heat gun. 
- you will need to monitor and experiment with the temperature. too much heat will deform and bubble the filament, too less heat will  result in a poor join
- use a multimiter with temperature probe.
How it works ?
The heat shrink tubing encloses the filament ends and also pushes them together when it shrinks. The diagonal cuts increase the joint area. Results are super strong and seamless joints. You might need to do a little sanding until you establish the right temperature for your setup.
I made a video how to do it :
https://youtu.be/eJeU9lXiQPE

Rather than just posting a video link, it is better to describe answer and provide the link for more detail on the technique.

Nice method but it takes so much time it doesn't seem worth it to spare a few meters of filament. Time is money :-)

I haven't tried this but it is something I have thought about. The simplest way to try this that I could think of was to try cutting the ends flat and then using a soldering iron or just the printers printing nozzle to melt the ends and then quickly press them together, then you could sand the filamelt to try and clean up the join. 
I think what would work better than trying to get the width perfect would be to make sure your printer is doing infill when it hits the join so over or under extrusion wont matter as much or have the printer move to the side of the print and extrude in thin air while getting past the join. I have done this when swapping filaments during a print by pausing the printer, and changing the filament.

idea is good and i know for sure many are working on it but if you want this to work smoothly you may need to fix the device (that is joining two filaments) somewhere near your cutter assembly (if any)arranged to cut the filament...this is the another way to perform the task automatically but you can do it separately with devices available to cut and join the two filaments together. 
links below:
http://diy3dprinting.blogspot.in/2014/07/fuse-clamp-filament-welding-device-for.html

Please describe the process rather than linking it, links can become broken and information lost.  Links are fine as long as you describe the process here.  Right now I have no idea what your answer says.

H5N1 in cats
8 March 2006
At the end of February 2006 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), caused by the H5N1 virus was detected in a domestic cat found dead on the northern island of Ruegen, Germany. Since mid-February, over 100 birds have died on this island and tests confirmed H5N1 infection. Also in Asia, cats and other felidae have been occasionally found to be infected with H5N1 since the start of the poultry epidemic in 2003. Experimental studies have shown that the domestic cat can become infected with the virus and that cat to cat transmission is possible in principle. The virus causes respiratory disease which can lead to death in all cat species. Serological studies in several Asian countries suggest that dogs may also contract the H5N1 infection. Countries in Europe have advised owners of pets living near H5N1 wild bird foci to keep cats indoors and dogs on a leash when taken for a walk.
These recent events lead to many questions by the public and pet owners to which the veterinary profession has to respond. In addition, there may be exposure of pet owners and veterinarians. For example, when animals infected with H5N1 (eg birds, dogs and cats) are brought to the veterinary clinic. Important are also the contribution veterinary practitioners can make in the surveillance of the disease for the presence of the H5N1 infection.
This section provides information for the general public and professionals about the risk of cats contracting H5N1 virus and the role of cats in the spread of avian influenza H5N1.
During a H5N1 outbreak in poultry in 1997 in Hong Kong, the first clinical human cases of this sub-type were reported with several fatalities. From the end of 2003 to date (March 2006) 173 people have been confirmed infected with the H5N1 virus of which 93 have died. Except for 1 case, human-to-human transmission has probably not occurred. Although H5N1 is relatively common to wild birds and poultry, humans and other mammals are also at risk of HPAI infection. Highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry is of growing concern due to the current geographic extent comprising Asia, Africa and Europe showing potential for pandemic spread. The virus is highly contagious and already over 200 million domestic birds have either been culled or died of the disease. Table 1 shows the timeline for avian influenza in cats and other felidae.
|Timeline of (H5N1) avian influenza in cats and other felidae (and civets)
|1970s & 1980s
||Research revealed that infection of domestic cats with influenza A subtypes H3N2 from humans, H7N3 from a turkey, and H7N7 from a harbor seal (Phoc vitulina) produces transient virus excretion and a temporary increase in body temperature but did not induce any other clinical signs of disease.
||Two leopards and two tigers died at a zoo in Thailand after feeding on chicken carcasses. Investigation confirmed H5N1 in tissue samples from all 4 animals. This was the first report of influenza causing disease and death in big cats.
||Research shows that domestic cats experimentally
infected with H5N1 develop severe disease and can spread
infection to other cats.
||A H5N1 outbreak in zoo tigers in Thailand reportedly
fed on chicken carcasses. Eventually, 147 out of the
population of 441 tigers died or had to euthanized for
animal welfare reasons.
||Tests on three civets that died late June 2005 in
Viet Nam revealed H5N1, marking the first infection
of this species with the virus. These endangered Owston’s
palm civets were raised in captivity; source of infection
is still unknown.
October 05 February 06
||FAO field veterinarians report unusual high cat mortality
in Iraq and Indonesia in the vicinity of H5N1 outbreaks
28 February 2006
||H5N1 confirmed in a cat on the Baltic Sea island
of Ruegen (Germany). Over 100 wild birds had been found
dead on the island during previous weeks.
Role of cats in virus transmission
Research has shown that domestic cats may die from H5N1 virus. Also horizontal transmission has been proven. However, it is unlikely that cats play a role in the natural transmission cycle of H5N1 viruses. Cat infections occasionally occur in association with H5N1 outbreaks in domestic or wild birds, e.g. when cats feed on infected birds. Experimental/infected cats shed the virus via the respiratory and intestinal tract, and may therefore transmit the virus to other cats. Naturally infected cats are thus in theory, able to spread the virus.
In areas where H5N1 Infected wild birds are reported it can not be excluded that cats become infected. Although most wild birds infected are waterfowl, not normally the species cats interact with, H5N1 is potentially infectious to numerous other bird species and it can not be ruled out that passerines or pigeons which do interact with cats get infected.
In areas where poultry is infected with H5N1 there is a risk that cats become infected with H5N1 through contact with infected poultry or their faeces. Anecdotal reports support the notion that contact with infected poultry (faeces and eating infected carcasses) forms a source of infection for cats. Cats probably have little or no contribution to the spread of the disease because the number of infected poultry is much higher than the number of infected cats; poultry shed much more virus than cats. Nevertheless, cats may play a role in the spread of the virus to other animals. Report to the local veterinary authority any evidence of significant animal mortality both wild and domestic.
Theoretically there is a possibility that cats transmit infection to humans. However, given the risk that cats become infected with HPAI is low, the risk to human infection is therefore limited.
The role of stray cats
Due to their greater mobility, stray cats could spread the disease into new areas. If infected, stray cats may become a source of contamination to poultry and mammals, including humans.
The role of other mammals
The ability of catching the H5N1 virus is not restricted to cats. Reports show infection in tigers, leopards and civets. Also dogs and pigs may become infected with the virus. Given the broad host spectrum of the H5N1virus, the possibility that also other wild or domesticated mammals including seals, mustelidae or furbearing animals, become infected by contacting infected animals is present. All carnivores could become infected through eating infected poultry or infected wild birds.
Areas where H5N1 HPAI has been diagnosed or is suspected in poultry or wild birds:
- Report to the local veterinary authority any evidence of significant bird mortality both wild and domestic.
- Be especially vigilant for any dead or sick cats and report such findings to the local veterinarian.
- Make sure contact between cats and wild birds or poultry (or their faeces) is avoided and/or keep cats inside.
- If cats bring a sick or dead bird inside the house, put on plastic gloves and dispense of the bird in plastic bags for collection by local veterinary animal handlers.
- Keep stray cats outside the house and avoid contact with them.
- If cats show breathing problems or nasal discharge, a veterinarian should be consulted.
- Do not touch or handle any sick-looking or dead cat (or other animal) and report to the authorities.
- Wash hands with water and soap regularly and especially after handling animals and cleaning their litter boxes or coming in contact with faeces or saliva.
- Dogs can only be taken outside the premises if kept restraint.
- Do not feed any water birds.
- Disinfect (e.g. with bleach 2-3 %) cages or other hardware in which sick animals have been transported or been in contact.
- Wash animal blankets with soap or any other commercial detergent.

If you ask them, they will tell you that you can teach them anything if you make it matter to them.
The easiest way is to make it about them. Nearly 20 years ago, when I took over the History Department of a Nairobi School, the most successful thing I did was to introduce a family tree project.
I had Kikuyu students in my classroom, and Luo and Kalenjin and several born in Britain as well as five or six born in Nairobi but with parents or grandparents born in the Indian Subcontinent. Computers barely existed, so all information was gathered by talking to family members, either in person or on the phone, waiting for visits or even writing letters. Everyone had to keep notes and start drawing their tree – and as they grew, the trees became collages, with stories and even artefacts stuck on: a coin, a bead, a piece of cloth, a photograph.
My students held court, sharing their research and findings, feeling the thrill of an attentive audience. They were the experts on their own lives, and they loved it (a lot more than Napoleon, who they’d done the previous term).
Of course you can’t design thirteen or fourteen years of curriculum around ‘Me’ – at least not without creating a generation of narcissistic monsters. But taking time to relate distant or abstract material to those in the room, and finding ways to engage heart and emotions as well as head, makes excellent educational sense.
This is one area where education can learn from the non-profit sector which has long understood that you engage people by creating proximity. It’s hard to care about people of whom we know nothing in a faraway country; the trick is to tell stories to bring them closer, to show the similarities between their lives and ours, to help us understand how it might feel to be them. To make it more real.
Carl Jung wrote that people cannot stand too much reality, but I disagree: in my experience, teenagers gobble it up. It brings out the best in them, differentiating them as individuals with both abilities and passions.
2 years ago Mayor of London Boris Johnson and I both hit on the idea of a London Curriculum (although I’m pretty sure I thought of it first.) I based mine on an experimental class I’d taught a few years before in the US that used our local city as a classroom. Part of my inspiration also came from CITYTerm, a brilliant programme run out of the Masters School, which uses New York City as a classroom and laboratory. In both cases the approach was project-based and relied on collaboration with experts from the city – architects, engineers, poets, social workers and entrepreneurs.
It can come as something of a shock to learn what’s on your doorstep: the things that are closest to us exert huge influence, yet we seldom look at them carefully, let alone understand them.
The nearly 4 million people who have seen Chimamanda Adichie’s TED Talk on the danger of a single story will also have heard her descriptions of growing up on a Nigerian university campus reading British and American children’s books. She loved those books, but because of them, the first stories she wrote featured characters with white skin and blue eyes, who played in the snow and ate apples. Only later did she realise that people who looked and thought like her could be in books too.
In January I met Deborah Ahenkorah, Ghanaian Echoing Green Fellow and founder of the Golden Baobab Prize for African literature for children and young adults. She created the prize because
“the tremendous lack of good quality African children’s literature dawned on me. A continent so large and richly diverse has tons of wonderful stories to share with young people everywhere: where were these stories?”
Last year they had more than 400 entries from 25 African countries. They also run workshops for writers and illustrators, and have plans to establish distribution channels across the continent to ensure that African books reach African children in their schools and, at last, in their own homes.
And it’s not just African children on the continent who need stories about themselves. There are millions of children of African heritage in the diaspora who never read stories that connect them with their own identities either. For stories cross continents too. Last month in Ghana I visited the slave castles of the Gold Coast and saw the door of no return through which millions of men, women and children left, many of whom ended their days in Jamaica. With over 200,000 Ghanaians and 250,000 Jamaicans in London, shouldn’t these stories be told in British schools too?
Who else is in our classrooms? Are we telling their stories?
Growing up is an identity project, and if we want to engage young people, we need to show them that school is the place to learn about the things they care about. We do that best by nurturing schools’ most valuable secret weapons – infectiously enthusiastic teachers. They are an endangered species now, killed by the growing exam culture and an obsession with cookie-cutter, lockstep learning, but they are still there. Let’s hope that those who have been taught by them will realise that it is loving learning that matters most, and the freedom to explore who you are and how you will take your place in the world.

Clinical complications associated with diabetes may include the following:
Cardiovascular disease, in many cases, is caused by atherosclerosis - an excess build-up of plaque on the inner wall of a large blood vessel, which restricts the flow of blood. Heart disease is the leading cause of diabetes-related deaths. Heart disease and stroke are two to four times more common in persons with diabetes.
High blood pressure affects 73 percent of persons with diabetes.
Periodontal (gum) disease occurs with greater frequency in persons with diabetes.
retinopathy or glaucoma (eye disease or blindness)
Blindness due to diabetic retinopathy is a more important cause of visual impairment in younger-onset people than in older-onset people. Males with younger-onset diabetes generally develop retinopathy more rapidly than females with younger-onset diabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness among adults ages 20 to 74.

Advance decision, or living will
An advance decision, more commonly known as a living will, allows you to make important choices to be carried out when end of life medical decisions have to be taken. Jessica Tomlin describes the benefits.
What is an advance decision?
An advance decision - formerly known as a 'living will' - is a document that enables health care professionals to know your treatment wishes should you no longer be able to communicate them.
Advance decision can also be known as advance directive.
The most relevant feature of an advance decision is the section that enables you to state that you wish to refuse treatment, including life-sustaining treatment, should you lose the capacity to make these decisions in the future.
Compassion in Dying have produced an advance decision document, including very helpful guidance notes.
My Last Song suggest you download the form. Before you fill it in, discuss your decisions with your GP and close family members.
Why make an advance decision?
There are many benefits associated with making an advance decision, or more commonly, having a living will:
- Taking control: Advance decisions give you more control of your end of life care and treatment;
- Peace of mind: Advance decisions provide you and your family with the peace of mind that your wishes will be respected and that, in certain circumstances, your life will not be prolonged against their wishes;
- Legally binding: Advance decisions have been given statutory force under the Mental Capacity Act in October 2007 so that any decision to refuse treatment is legally binding;
- Better decision making: Making an advance decision is a good opportunity to discuss your wishes with close family and your doctor.
Limitations of advance decisions
An advance decision can't be used to:
- ask for your life to be ended;
- force doctors to act against their professional judgement;
- nominate someone else to decide about treatment on your behalf.
As with advance statements, bear in mind that new drugs or treatments may be introduced in the future so you may wish to allow for new treatments even if refusing a current one.
Who can make an advance decision?
Anyone who is mentally competent and over 18 can make an advance decision.
You should review your advance decision regularly - perhaps every couple of years - to check that you are still happy with what it contains. You may want to change certain treatment requests or change your mind about refusing treatment.
Who should have a copy?
Five copies may seem a lot, but as with a will, it is vital that this document is found as soon as it is required to ensure your wishes are carried out. These are the people who you should give a copy to:
- One copy to your GP;
- One copy to a trusted friend;
- One copy to a trusted family member;
- One copy with your solicitor;
- One copy to keep yourself. You can also carry a credit-card sized card stating that you have an advance decision.
Consider keeping a digital copy in your Lifebox. You will be the only person able to access it, and then update it if required.
You can give your second key holder permission to open your Lifebox when you feel you losing the capacity to make cohesive decisions about your end of life care.
Remember to replace old copies with new copies if you update your advance decision.
An advance decision enables you to state the scenarios in which you would or would not wish to receive further treatment.
- if you are terminally ill with no reasonable prospect of recovery;
- if you suffer a serious mental impairment; or
- if you are persistently unconscious for X amount of weeks.
In a Pro-Choice advance decision - which also lets you state which treatments you do consent to - you can also state any spiritual and personal wishes that you wish to be taken into account, although this section is purely advisory and not legally binding.

While any kind of dog can attack, some breeds are more prone to attacks than others. In fact, some dogs are more likely than others to kill humans.
The Centers of Disease Control estimates that more than 4.7 million people are bitten by dogs every year. Of those, 20 percent require medical attention.
In a 15-year study (1979-1994) a total of 239 deaths were reported as a result of injuries from dog attacks in the United States. Through its research, the CDC compiled a list of the dogs most responsible for human fatalities. They are as follows:
The study found that most dog-bite-related deaths happened to children. But, according to the CDC there are steps children (and adults) can take cut down the risk of a dog attack from family pets as well as dogs they are not familiar with:
-Don't approach an unfamiliar dog.
-If an unfamiliar dog approaches you, stay motionless.
-Don't run from a dog or scream.
-If a dog knocks you down, roll into a ball and stay still.
-Avoid looking directly into a dog's eyes.
-Leave a dog alone that is sleeping, eating or taking care of puppies.
-Let a dog see and sniff you before petting it.
-Don't play with a dog unless there is an adult present.
-If a dog bites you, tell an adult immediately.
But, the CDC's report says most attacks are preventable in three ways:
1. "Owner and public education. Dog owners, through proper selection, socialization, training, care, and treatment of a dog, can reduce the likelihood of owning a dog that will eventually bite. Male and unspayed/unneutered dogs are more likely to bite than are female and spayed/neutered dogs."
2. "Animal control at the community level. Animal-control programs should be supported, and laws for regulating dangerous or vicious dogs should be promulgated and enforced vigorously. For example, in this report, 30% of dog-bite-related deaths resulted from groups of owned dogs that were free roaming off the owner's property."
3. "Bite reporting. Evaluation of prevention efforts requires improved surveillance for dog bites. Dog bites should be reported as required by local or state ordinances, and reports of such incidents should include information about the circumstances of the bite; ownership, breed, sex, age, spay/neuter status, and history of prior aggression of the animal; and the nature of restraint before the bite incident."
CDC officials did make one important note about its list: The reporting of the breed was subjective. There is no way to determine if the identification of the breed was correct. Also, there is no way to verify if the dog was a purebred or a mixed breed.

How much fun is it to be a child in your home? Do you ever stop to think about how the house looks from their point of view? My task for this week is to conduct a Child’s Eye Audit of our living space, to try and make the rooms more child- and play-friendly. The audit need only take a few minutes and might suggest simple changes to make to improve the play space.
To conduct a child’s eye audit, sit or kneel down so you’re at your child’s eye-level and consider the following things.
1. Safety first. Most importantly, the room needs to be safe and it’s useful t0 review this aspect of your home from time to time as children grow taller, become more mobile or more adventurous. Think about what your child can reach, what you don’t want them to reach and make any necessary adjustments.
2. Child’s eye view. Sit back for a minute on the floor and scan the room. What’s visible to your child at their height, and what’s not? You might display all their lovely paintings on the wall and fridge door – but are they too high for your child to actually see? Is their view just of empty walls? Hang some art work at a lower level or set up a low shelf or table with a display of things they can enjoy.
3. Within reach. Consider how accessible your toys are. Do you have an enabling environment where your child can independently help themselves to toys and resources to use in their play or is everything out of reach? Try to find a balance so you can keep the space tidy whilst still allowing free access. Open shelving and low baskets work well for us with some materials such as paint stored higher up.
4. Ring the changes. Do you always have they same toys out? Sometimes putting away familiar toys and bringing out some forgotten ones can spark new creativity and fun. Don’t have a complete change of resources though, as children do like to know where favourite toys are. With Christmas on the way now is a good time to have a toy audit, donating ones your child has grown out of to the charity shop and getting ideas for their Christmas list.
5. Invitation to play. Do you have any toys that never get played with, or activities that you child rarely takes part in? What can you change to make things more inviting? If you’d like to encourage some more reading, perhaps you could set up a cosy reading corner or story tent – with comfy cushions, a basket of tempting books and a favourite teddy to share with? If your toy kitchen has been ignored for a while, add some new resources to catch your child’s eye: a muffin tin and paper cake cases, some jars of real dried pasta, a recipe book from your shelf or lay the table for a birthday tea and surprise your child with a new play possibility.
Do you sometimes review things from your child’s point of view? What changes have you made to make your space more child- and play- friendly? Leave a comment and share an idea with us.
I’m writing this at one o’clock in the afternoon and the sky is grey and the rain is tumbling down. It’s making me think about how the weather affects our play, and particularly I’m thinking about how much time we spend outdoors in autumn and winter. I don’t think there’s any question that playing outside is wonderful for children: the fresh air, the feeling of space, the sensory benefits of being in nature. I certainly know with my own two girls, and all the children I’ve looked after, that if we’re having a grumpy sort of day, getting outside – in the garden, park or just for a walk – most often is all that’s needed to lighten everyone’s mood.
But it’s getting colder now, and windy and rainy and dark. If you’re the type who is happy to be outside all the time in all weathers, I really do salute you. I however am naturally inclined to prefer a hot cup of coffee and a warm blanket inside! We do play outside everyday, whatever the weather, but there’s no denying we play outdoors less in winter – which I’m guessing is the same for lots of you? So, I’m resolving to put more thought into getting out there and planning on bringing you some posts over the next few months that inspire us to venture out. I’d also like to invite you to share your ideas too. The Play Academy carnival on Friday is open to any of your posts and I’d also love to hear from you if you’d like to write a guest post here. (On any play subject in fact, not just on playing outside. You can e-mail me cathy (at) nurturestore (dot) co (dot) uk if you have an idea you’d like to write about).
To start us off, my top three tips for getting outside, whatever the weather are…
- Keep yourself warm. If you’re wearing the right clothes, you’re much more likely to enjoy your time outside. Pretty much all the children I know don’t care if it’s cold, windy or raining – they are active kids and just love being outside. So, to help everyone enjoy themselves outside, and to stop you cutting short the children’s outdoor fun because you’ve had enough, my first tip is to make sure you are wearing the right clothes. Layer up, don’t forget your hat and gloves and make sure you are cosy.
- Get active. We’re going to shift our outdoor play away from fairy gardens and dinosaur world’s and include lots more active games. Hopscotch, skipping, what’s the time Mr. Wolf are great fun and will keep everyone on the move.
- Audit your outdoor space. Now is a good time to review your garden and get it ready for the colder months. Think about what you play outside and re-locate things or make changes to suit the weather. We’ll move the sandpit and den to under our covered area and make sure there are lots of props outside ready to spark active play (bikes, balls, kites, hula hoops). We’re not likely to do as much water play outside, so I’ll be thinking of ways to bring this inside.
What about you – are you an all weather family? How do you promote lots of outdoor play, whatever the weather?
Back in January I resolved to make 2010 our Year of Play. I’ve been thinking about this again this month as L has started at school. In last week’s Play Academy link-up I talked about wanting to make sure the girls still have lots of opportunity for playing, as well as schooling. So this weeks Twitter Tips are dedicated to having a playful return to school. The Twitter Tips get tweeted on a Friday at 8.30pm and in previous weeks they’ve started great twitter conversations, with people swapping ideas. The main thing I love about blogging is it being a forum to get inspiration and encouragement from others, so please feel free to add your own ideas in the comments or on our Facebook page. Join in, swap ideas, go play!

Use the linky below to add your post to the Play Academy
Our summer holidays are drawing to a close and my Little is starting school on Monday (oh my!). I feel very strongly that our play should keep going. B is moving up to the Juniors and although her school offers are great curriculum including play, art, music, drama and experiments I think it’s inevitable that her lessons will become more and more about schooling. September always feels like the start of the year to me, so I’m keeping in mind my resolution to make 2010 our Year of Play, and we’ll certainly be limiting our after school clubs and weekend commitments to allow plenty of time for playing. How do you feel about finding a balance between schooling (or home educating) and play?
I’m looking forward to getting even more inspiration from your Play Academy ideas this week – hope you’ll add a link.

Books Yellow, Red, and Green and Blue,
All true, or just as good as true,
And here's the Blue Book just for YOU!
Hard is the path from A to Z,
And puzzling to a curly head,
Yet leads to Books—Green, Yellow and Red.
For every child should understand
That letters from the first were planned
To guide us into Fairy Land
So labour at your Alphabet,
For by that learning shall you get
To lands where Fairies may be met.
And going where this pathway goes,
You too, at last, may find, who knows?
The Garden of the Singing Rose.
As to whether there are really any fairies or not, that is a difficult question. The Editor never saw any himself, but he knew several people who have seen them-in the Highlands-and heard their music.
If ever you are in Nether Lochaber, go to the Fairy Hill, and you may hear the music your-self, as grown-up people have done, but you must go on a fine day.
This book has been especially re-published to raise funds for:
The Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity
By buying this book you will be donating to this great charity that does so much good for ill children and which also enables families to stay together in times of crisis. And what better way to help children than to buy a book of fairy tales. Some have not been seen in print or heard for over a century. 33% of the Publisher’s profit from the sale of this book will be donated to the GOSH Children’s Charity.
YESTERDAYS BOOKS for TODAYS CHARITIES
LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD
Once upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had made for her a little red riding-hood; which became the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding-Hood.
One day her mother, having made some custards, said to her:
"Go, my dear, and see how thy grandmamma does, for I hear she has been very ill; carry her a custard, and this little pot of butter."
Little Red Riding-Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.
As she was going through the wood, she met with Gaffer Wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some faggot-makers hard by in the forest. He asked her whither she was going. The poor child, who did not know that it was dangerous to stay and hear a wolf talk, said to him:
"I am going to see my grandmamma and carry her a custard and a little pot of butter from my mamma."
"Does she live far off?" said the Wolf.
"Oh! aye," answered Little Red Riding-Hood; "it is beyond that mill you see there, at the first house in the village."
"Well," said the Wolf, "and I'll go and see her too. I'll go this way and you go that, and we shall see who will be there soonest."
The Wolf began to run as fast as he could, taking the nearest way, and the little girl went by that farthest about, diverting herself in gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and making nosegays of such little flowers as she met with. The Wolf was not long before he got to the old woman's house. He knocked at the door—tap, tap.
"Your grandchild, Little Red Riding-Hood," replied the Wolf, counterfeiting her voice; "who has brought you a custard and a little pot of butter sent you by mamma."
The good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out:
"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up."The Wolf pulled the bobbin, and the door opened, and then presently he fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it was above three days that he had not touched a bit. He then shut the door and went into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding-Hood, who came some time afterward and knocked at the door—tap, tap.
Little Red Riding-Hood, hearing the big voice of the Wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had got a cold and was hoarse, answered:
"’Tis your grandchild, Little Red Riding-Hood, who has brought you a custard and a little pot of butter mamma sends you."
The Wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could:
"Pull the bobbin, and the latch will go up."
Little Red Riding-Hood pulled the bobbin, and the door opened.
The Wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bed-clothes:
"Put the custard and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come and lie down with me."
Little Red Riding-Hood undressed herself and went into bed, where, being greatly amazed to see how her grandmother looked in her night-clothes, she said to her:
"Grandmamma, what great arms you have got!"
"That is the better to hug thee, my dear."
"Grandmamma, what great legs you have got!"
"That is to run the better, my child."
"Grandmamma, what great ears you have got!"
"That is to hear the better, my child."
"Grandmamma, what great eyes you have got!"
"It is to see the better, my child."
"Grandmamma, what great teeth you have got!"
"That is to eat thee up."
And, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding-Hood, and tried to start eating her. Red Riding Hood screamed “Someone Help Me!” over and over again.
The woodcutter, who was felling trees nearby, heard Red Riding Hood’s screams for help and ran to the cottage. He burst in to find the wolf trying to eat Red Riding Hood.
He swung his axe, and with one blow killed the bad wolf for which Red Riding Hood was ever so grateful.

Vedic Art: Indian Miniature Painting, Part 14
BY: SUN STAFF
Ahmadnagar, c. 1595
Dec 26, 2011 CANADA (SUN) A serial presentation of India's artistic legacy in paintings, sculpture and temple architecture.
THE DECCANI SCHOOLS
16th to 18th Centuries
Like the group of Bikaner paintings featured in yesterday's segment, of Govinda fluting with His cows, there are many beautiful Vaisnava themes to be found among the Deccan Miniatures. Today we take a brief look at paintings from the Ahmednagar School, a sub-category of the Deccan School. In the Ahmednagar Miniatures, Vaisnava themes are overshadowed by the Persian influence, no doubt because the earliest examples of this school are no longer in existence.
Ahmednagar, Maharashtra, situated about 250 km. due east of Mumbai, was an Islamic kingdom during the Sixteenth Century. During the late Iron Age it was part of the territory of the Sattavahanas and during the 1st Millennium A.D. it was ruled by the Yadavas, until it fell to the Muslim intruders.
Ragamala, Ahmednagar, 17th c.
Nearly all the early examples of Ahmednagar painting are in the Persian style, an influence seen not only in themes, but also in the richly brilliant colors, high horizons, golden skies and landscapes, and gilt scripts framing the wide borders of manuscript illustrations. This style is equally evident in Ahmednagar School Ragamala illustrations of the period.
In the Ragamala illustration of Vasanta Raga above, the painting is bordered along with top with the Raga verse in Devanagari script vas (anta). Not shown is an additional caption above that, in Arabic characters, which mislabels the painting as Hindola Raga and Vasant Ragini. The raga depicted is actually the Vasanta, and it was no doubt the introduction of the swing (hindola) that led to the confusion of titles.
The Sanskrit verses for this Raga describe how Vasanta (the male personification of Spring, or Kamadeva) is sprayed with holi colors by young maids in a mango grove, on a Kashmiri mountain. Praised by strings of bees, he disports himself on a swing. Like a blue lotus (dark complexioned) and dressed in a tawny garment, he holds in his fingers the shoots of the fresh mango.
In the painting, the young male Spring wears a four-pointed coat, a fashionable style worn during the reign of Akbar. This aspect of the figure may have been adopted by the artist from a Malwa influence. The distinctive feature of the women's costumes are the projecting transparent veils, a style also found in the Nimat Namah (cookbook) of Malwa. This may tie it to the Chaurapanchasika Group of Miniatures, perhaps developed in its classical form in Malwa or south Rajasthan during the second half of the 16th Century. This detail of costume does point to the northern Deccan origin of this Vasanta Raga illustration.

While doing reviews I noticed this answer.  Innocent enough yet an odd answer for someone so new, upon checking their history I found another (their only other answer) that is nearly identical to this one and happens to be on the Blender site...
To me it seems an awful lot like an advertisement but whoever viewed the flag marked it as not spam.  At what point is it?  The only contributions to the site are both links to the same website.

I've added a comment to the answer asking whether or not they are affiliated with the site. If they are, it might still make a valid answer, but they should always disclose their affiliation. In principle, it can be acceptable to post about your own website or product so long as it makes a valid answer.

The community here tends to vote down overt self-promotion and flag it as spam. Post good, relevant answers, and if some (but not all) happen to be about your product or website, that’s okay. However, you must disclose your affiliation in your answers.

Supporting Your Student While Letting Go
The college years can be exciting and stressful for both you and your child. Exciting, because your child will be learning to live independently, and this allows both of you to explore other parts of your lives. Stressful, because this means that your relationship will change. Some find this process enjoyable; others do not. In order for this transition to be as productive as possible, you will need to be patient, understanding, supportive, and clear and reasonable about your expectations. Listed below are some tips you might find helpful during this process.
- Rule #1: Don’t ask if he is homesick. While it is true that many students miss being at home, most are so busy in the first weeks of school that they do just fine, as long as nothing reminds them about being away from home. Even if he never brings it up, you can rest assured that he does miss you. If your student is really homesick, encourage him to stick it out for one semester.
- Rule #2: Write, even if she doesn't write back. Your student will be exploring and enjoying her independence and this is necessary for her development. Even so, she will want to keep her family ties, as well as the security those ties bring. It’s nice for her to receive things in the mail (and depressing when the box is empty). Still, she may not respond for some time. Don’t interpret silence as rejection.
- Rule #3: Ask questions (but not too many). First-year students tend to resent interference with their newfound lifestyles, but most still want to know that someone is still interested in them. Parental curiosity can be experienced as supportive or alienating, depending on the attitudes of the people involved. Honest inquiries that further the parent bond are welcomed. Pulling rank, “I have a right to know” questions, and hidden agendas should be avoided.
- Rule #4: Expect change (but not too much). It is natural and inevitable that your student will change over the course of his time here. For some, this change is gradual. For others, it is quick and dramatic. This can be quite stressful for all involved. It helps to remember that young adults should be forming their own identities, and that it is counterproductive to try and stop them from doing so. While you may never understand the changes in your child's social, vocational, and personal choices that may occur in college, it is within your power to accept them. Maturation can be a slow and painful learning process. Please be patient.
- Rule #5: Don’t worry excessively about moody behavior. You might find parenting during the college years to be pretty thankless. Your student may sometimes feel overwhelmed with all that is happening, and she might turn to you in distress. Conversely, you may rarely hear from her when things are going well. You are serving as a “touchstone” for your student, someone she can turn to when she feels the need. Regardless of what she might say, this is valuable to her. If your student’s “bad mood” seems persistent and you have concerns about it, call the Office of Student Health Services to discuss it further.
- Rule #6: Visit (but not too often). Whether they admit it or not, students usually appreciate visits from their parents. This gives them a chance to connect to both of their “worlds” at once. “Surprise” visits are usually not appreciated because they can feel disrespectful. It is better to wait for planned visits, such as the Family Weekend opportunity. After that, arrange times that are convenient for you and your student. When you do visit, treat your child to a meal away from the dining hall or offer to do the laundry. Your visits will be eagerly anticipated!
- Rule #7: Avoid the “These are the best years of your life” speech. The college years are full of discovery, inspiration, good times and friends. But they are also marked by indecision, insecurity, disappointment, and mistakes. In all probability your student will learn that college is much more challenging, in every way, than he imagined. Parents who think that college students “have it made,” and that they should always perform well and be worry-free are wrong. Those who accept the highs and lows are providing the kind of support students need most.
- Rule #8: Trust your student. Finding oneself is a difficult enough process without feeling like the people whose opinions you respect most are second-guessing your own second-guessing. One mother wrote her son during his senior year: “I love you and want for you all the things that make you happiest: and I guess you, not I, are the one who knows best what those things are.” If you’re smart, you’ll believe it, mean it, and say it now!

What kind of galvos are used in Moai SLA printers?
There are some very cheap SLA printers available, working with galvo scanners and 405 nm lasers to expose a fluid resin.
I am looking for the galvos which are used in these projects. Does anyone know a manufacturer or supplier for these components?
One good example is the Moai SLA printer. I've seen the galvos and circuit boards in an assembly video on youtube but I can't figure out where these components are from. See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTRUMETt9qY#t=133
The lable says AT40-314X but I can't find anything useful.

Here you can find some pictures of the components if you don't want to open the youtube link:

After watching the video I don't think that sticker has anything to do with the motors as a very similar sticker is on the control boards.  I think it is a part identifier they use for the instructions.

They look quite similar to these DJ scanners - but I've no experience in galvos, there could be a large difference https://www.ebay.com/itm/20Kpps-Laser-Scanning-Galvo-Galvanometer-Scanner-Set-For-DJ-Laser-Light-Show/223107665479?hash=item33f240ce47:g:rF8AAOSwDyBbeCa6

Making a plunger
Help, I know how to print simple cookie cutter style molds, but I need to know how to turn that open shape into a closed smaller version that can be used as a plunger.  Reason being, is I make bath bombs, so it would be so much easier to get bombs out of molds if I could make a plunger.  Thank you so much for any help!!

It's important to provide information regarding the program you are using to model your molds. Even without that information, there are general methods to produce the portion you require. 
Consider that you already have the outer portion, what you describe reasonably well as a cookie cutter style. If you are using someone else's model cookie cutter shape, the following will still apply.
Most programs have a subtractive feature. An easy program that provides this feature would be Tinkercad. Running with that program, the steps would be as follows:

import the current cookie cutter shape 
scale up the shape to ensure
that the inner portion is decreased, by increasing the wall
thickness. It is expected that scaling up the shape will enlarge both
the outside wall and inside wall of the cookie cutter shape create a
block that will encompass the cookie cutter, circular or rectangular
as desired. 
use the subtractive feature to remove the cookie cutter
shape from the block 
this should also segment the outer portion of
the block, which would be removed, leaving the inside cookie shape.

Young goats learn new and distinctive bleating "accents" once they begin to socialise with other kids.
The discovery is a surprise because the sounds most mammals make were thought to be too primitive to allow subtle variations to emerge or be learned. The only known exceptions are humans, bats and cetaceans – although many birds, including songbirds, parrots and hummingbirds have legendary song-learning or mimicry abilities.
Now, goats have joined the club. "It's the first ungulate to show evidence of this," says Alan McElligott of Queen Mary, University of London.
McElligott and his colleague, Elodie Briefer, made the discovery using 23 newborn kids. To reduce the effect of genetics, all were born to the same father, but from several mothers, so the kids were a mixture of full siblings plus their half-brothers and sisters.
The researchers allowed the kids to stay close to their mothers, and recorded their bleats at the age of 1 week. Then, the 23 kids were split randomly into four separate "gangs" ranging from five to seven animals. When all the kids reached 5 weeks, their bleats were recorded again. "We had about 10 to 15 calls per kid to analyse," says McElligott.
Some of the calls are clearly different to the human ear, but the full analysis picked out more subtle variations, based on 23 acoustic parameters. What emerged was that each kid gang had developed its own distinctive patois. "It probably helps with group cohesion," says McElligott.
"People presumed this didn't exist in most mammals, but hopefully now, they'll check it out in others," says McElligott. "It wouldn't surprise me if it's found in other ungulates and mammals."
Erich Jarvis of Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, says the results fit with an idea he has developed with colleague Gustavo Arriaga, arguing that vocal learning is a feature of many species.
"I would call this an example of limited vocal learning," says Jarvis. "It involves small modifications to innately specified learning, as opposed to complex vocal learning which would involve imitation of entirely novel sounds."

A Stronger Strong Schottky Lemma For Euclidean Buildings, 2023 The Graduate Center, City University of New York

#### A Stronger Strong Schottky Lemma For Euclidean Buildings, Michael E. Ferguson

##### Dissertations, Theses, and Capstone Projects

We provide a criterion for two hyperbolic isometries of a Euclidean building to generate a free group of rank two. In particular, we extend the application of a Strong Schottky Lemma to buildings given by Alperin, Farb and Noskov. We then use this extension to obtain an infinite family of matrices that generate a free group of rank two. In doing so, we also introduce an algorithm that terminates in finite time if the lemma is applicable for pairs of certain kinds of matrices acting on the Euclidean building for the special linear group over certain discretely valued fields.

Spectral Sequences And Khovanov Homology, 2023 Dartmouth College

#### Spectral Sequences And Khovanov Homology, Zachary J. Winkeler

##### Dartmouth College Ph.D Dissertations

In this thesis, we will focus on two main topics; the common thread between both will be the existence of spectral sequences relating Khovanov homology to other knot invariants. Our first topic is an invariant MKh(L) for links in thickened disks with multiple punctures. This invariant is different from but inspired by both the Asaeda-Pryzytycki-Sikora (APS) homology and its specialization to links in the solid torus. Our theory will be constructed from a Z^n-filtration on the Khovanov complex, and as a result we will get various spectral sequences relating MKh(L) to Kh(L), AKh(L), and APS(L). Our …

#### Slices Of C_2, Klein-4, And Quaternionic Eilenberg-Mac Lane Spectra, Carissa Slone

##### Theses and Dissertations--Mathematics

We provide the slice (co)towers of $$\Si{V} H_{C_2}\ul M$$ for a variety of $$C_2$$-representations $$V$$ and $$C_2$$-Mackey functors $$\ul M$$. We also determine a characterization of all 2-slices of equivariant spectra over the Klein four-group $$C_2\times C_2$$. We then describe all slices of integral suspensions of the equivariant Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum $$H\ulZ$$ for the constant Mackey functor over $$C_2\times C_2$$. Additionally, we compute the slices and slice spectral sequence of integral suspensions of $H\ulZ$ for the group of equivariance $Q_8$. Along the way, we compute the Mackey functors $$\mpi_{k\rho} H_{K_4}\ulZ$$ and $\mpi_{k\rho} H_{Q_8}\ulZ$.

#### On The Uniqueness Of Continuation Of A Partially Defined Metric, Evgeniy Petrov

##### Theory and Applications of Graphs

The problem of continuation of a partially defined metric can be efficiently studied using graph theory. Let $G=G(V,E)$ be an undirected graph with the set of vertices $V$ and the set of edges $E$. A necessary and sufficient condition under which the weight $w\colon E\to\mathbb R^+$ on the graph $G$ has a unique continuation to a metric $d\colon V\times V\to\mathbb R^+$ is found.

#### Multi-Trace Matrix Models From Noncommutative Geometry, Hamed Hessam

##### Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Repository

Dirac ensembles are finite dimensional real spectral triples where the Dirac operator is allowed to vary within a suitable family of operators and is assumed to be random. The Dirac operator plays the role of a metric on a manifold in the noncommutative geometry context of spectral triples. Thus, integration over the set of Dirac operators within a Dirac ensemble, a crucial aspect of a theory of quantum gravity, is a noncommutative analog of integration over metrics.

Dirac ensembles are closely related to random matrix ensembles. In order to determine properties of specific Dirac ensembles, we use techniques from random …

(R1518) The Dual Spherical Curves And Surfaces In Terms Of Vectorial Moments, 2022 Ordu University

#### (R1518) The Dual Spherical Curves And Surfaces In Terms Of Vectorial Moments, Süleyman Şenyurt, Abdussamet Çalışkan

##### Applications and Applied Mathematics: An International Journal (AAM)

In the article, the parametric expressions of the dual ruled surfaces are expressed in terms of the vectorial moments of the Frenet vectors. The integral invariants of these surfaces are calculated. It is seen that the dual parts of these invariants can be stated by the real terms. Finally, we present examples of the ruled surfaces with bases such as helix and Viviani’s curves.

#### Manufacturability And Analysis Of Topologically Optimized Continuous Fiber Reinforced Composites, Jesus A. Ferrand

##### Doctoral Dissertations and Master's Theses

Researchers are unlocking the potential of Continuous Fiber Reinforced Composites for producing components with greater strength-to-weight ratios than state of the art metal alloys and unidirectional composites. The key is the emerging technology of topology optimization and advances in additive manufacturing. Topology optimization can fine tune component geometry and fiber placement all while satisfying stress constraints. However, the technology cannot yet robustly guarantee manufacturability. For this reason, substantial post-processing of an optimized design consisting of manual fiber replacement and subsequent Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is still required.

To automate this post-processing in two dimensions, two (2) algorithms were developed. The …

Classifications Of Dupin Hypersurfaces In Lie Sphere Geometry, 2022 College of the Holy Cross

#### Classifications Of Dupin Hypersurfaces In Lie Sphere Geometry, Thomas E. Cecil

##### Mathematics Department Faculty Scholarship

This is a survey of local and global classification results concerning Dupin hypersurfaces in Sn (or Rn) that have been obtained in the context of Lie sphere geometry. The emphasis is on results that relate Dupin hypersurfaces to isoparametric hypersurfaces in spheres. Along with these classification results, many important concepts from Lie sphere geometry, such as curvature spheres, Lie curvatures, and Legendre lifts of submanifolds of Sn (or Rn), are described in detail. The paper also contains several important constructions of Dupin hypersurfaces with certain special properties.

#### Automorphism-Preserving Color Substitutions On Profinite Graphs, Michal Cizek

##### Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Repository

Profinite groups are topological groups which are known to be Galois groups. Their free product was extensively studied by Luis Ribes and Pavel Zaleskii using the notion of a profinite graph and having profinite groups act freely on such graphs. This thesis explores a different approach to study profinite groups using profinite graphs and that is with the notion of automorphisms and colors. It contains a generalization to profinite graphs of the theorem of Frucht (1939) that shows that every finite group is a group of automorphisms of a finite connected graph, and establishes a profinite analog of the theorem …

On The Thom Isomorphism For Groupoid-Equivariant Representable K-Theory, 2022 Dartmouth College

#### On The Thom Isomorphism For Groupoid-Equivariant Representable K-Theory, Zachary J. Garvey

##### Dartmouth College Ph.D Dissertations

This thesis proves a general Thom Isomorphism in groupoid-equivariant KK-theory. Through formalizing a certain pushforward functor, we contextualize the Thom isomorphism to groupoid-equivariant representable K-theory with various support conditions. Additionally, we explicitly verify that a Thom class, determined by pullback of the Bott element via a generalized groupoid homomorphism, coincides with a Thom class defined via equivariant spinor bundles and Clifford multiplication. The tools developed in this thesis are then used to generalize a particularly interesting equivalence of two Thom isomorphisms on TX, for a Riemannian G-manifold X.

#### Numerical Studies Of Correlated Topological Systems, Rahul Soni

##### Doctoral Dissertations

In this thesis, we study the interplay of Hubbard U correlation and topological effects in two different bipartite lattices: the dice and the Lieb lattices. Both these lattices are unique as they contain a flat energy band at E = 0, even in the absence of Coulombic interaction. When interactions are introduced both these lattices display an unexpected multitude of topological phases in our U -λ phase diagram, where λ is the spin-orbit coupling strength. We also study ribbons of the dice lattice and observed that they qualitative display all properties of their two-dimensional counterpart. This includes flat bands near …

Rendezvous Numbers Of Compact And Connected Spaces, 2022 University of Northern Iowa

#### Rendezvous Numbers Of Compact And Connected Spaces, Kevin Demler, Bill Wood Ph.D.

##### Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP) Symposium

The concept of a rendezvous number was originally developed by O. Gross in 1964, and was expanded upon greatly by J. Cleary, S. Morris, and D. Yost in 1986. This number exists for every metric space, yet very little is known about it, and it’s exact value for most spaces is not known. Furthermore, it’s exact value is difficult to calculate, and in most cases we can only find bounds for the value. We focused on their arguments using convexity and applied it to shapes in different metrics and graphs. Using sets of points that stood out (vertices, midpoints) as …

Left-Separation Of Ω1, 2022 University of Northern Iowa

#### Left-Separation Of Ω1, Lukas Stuelke, Adrienne Stanley Ph.D.

##### Summer Undergraduate Research Program (SURP) Symposium

A topological space is left-separated if it can be well-ordered so that every initial segment is closed. Here, we show that all countable ordinal numbers are left-separated. We then prove that a similar method could not work for ω1 , using the pressing-down lemma1 . We finish by showing that a left-separating well-ordering on ω1 necessarily leads to a contradiction.

On A Relation Between Ado And Links-Gould Invariants, 2022 Louisiana State University at Baton Rouge

##### LSU Doctoral Dissertations

In this thesis we consider two knot invariants: Akutsu-Deguchi-Ohtsuki(ADO) invariant and Links-Gould invariant. They both are based on Reshetikhin-Turaev construction and as such share a lot of similarities. Moreover, they are both related to the Alexander polynomial and may be considered generalizations of it. By experimentation we found that for many knots, the third order ADO invariant is a specialization of the Links-Gould invariant. The main result of the thesis is a proof of this relation for a large class of knots, specifically closures of braids with five strands.

#### General Covariance With Stacks And The Batalin-Vilkovisky Formalism, Filip Dul

##### Doctoral Dissertations

In this thesis we develop a formulation of general covariance, an essential property for many field theories on curved spacetimes, using the language of stacks and the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism. We survey the theory of stacks, both from a global and formal perspective, and consider the key example in our work: the moduli stack of metrics modulo diffeomorphism. This is then coupled to the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism–a formulation of field theory motivated by developments in derived geometry–to describe the associated equivariant observables of a theory and to recover and generalize results regarding current conservation.

(R1898) A Study On Inextensible Flows Of Polynomial Curves With Flc Frame, 2022 Ordu University

#### (R1898) A Study On Inextensible Flows Of Polynomial Curves With Flc Frame, Süleyman Şenyurt, Kemal Eren, Kebire Hilal Ayvacı

##### Applications and Applied Mathematics: An International Journal (AAM)

In this paper, we investigate the inextensible flows of polynomial space curves in R3. We calculate that the necessary and sufficient conditions for an inextensible curve flow are represented as a partial differential equation involving the curvatures. Also, we expressed the time evolution of the Frenet like curve (Flc) frame. Finally, an example of the evolution of the polynomial curve with Flc frame is given and graphed.

The white flower heads of the yarrow plant
Get acquainted with this hardy and handy groundcover
People are always looking to cover open rough spots in the lawn and around the property. Our hardy native yarrow (Achillea millefolium) establishes quickly and binds the soil to provide a soft, scented carpet. In the wilds of Western Canada, white flat-topped flower heads rise to 75 cm (30 in.) tall from a mass of ferny leaves.
Buy yarrow plants from a local garden centre or grow them from rooted stem fragments planted in fall or early spring. Many colour varieties are easy to raise from seed, and you can mow the spreading yarrow patch along with the grass.
Yarrow leaves rubbed on the skin or burned in a campfire keep away mosquitoes. A poultice from steeped leaves helps heal sores and reduce muscle pain.

### Lake-front property, expansive view of faint, red sun that never sets

 From right to left: Courtney Dressing, Dave Charbonneau and yours truly at the live CfA press conference. Photo by Kris Snibbe/Harvard Staff Photographer
Yesterday, I had the honor of participating in a live press conference today at the Harvard Center for Astrophysics (CfA). The event was to announce new findings by third-year graduate student Courtney Dressing and her advisor Dave Charbonneau, who studied the occurrence of planets around M dwarfs in the Kepler field. Dear Sara Seager, check it out! A woman with not only a big exoplanet press announcement, but a HUGE exoplanet press announcement! (But, yes, we need more).

Sound familiar? If so, it's because Jon Swift and I made a related announcement last month at the AAS meeting. But while we focused ont he bulk occurrence rate, finding 1.0 +/- 0.1 planets per M dwarf, Courtney focused on Earth-like planets. By Earth-like she means, "planets the size of the Earth that receive a similar amount of sun light as our planet." (As an aside, Jon and I were very much relieved and excited that Courtney's statistical analysis matched our result on the bulk occurrence rate.)

Her big results are

• 6% of M dwarfs (=red dwarfs) have Earth-like planets.
• This means that there are at least 6 billion Earth-like planets in the Galaxy since M dwarfs comprise 7 out of 10 of the Milky Way's stars
• The nearest Earth-like planet is around an M dwarf within 13 light years of the Earth. Which one? We don't know...yet. We need to start searching, like, yesterday IMO.
• At 95% confidence, there is a transiting Earth-like planet around an M dwarf within 100 light years.

Here's the CfA press release.

Here's a preprint of Courtney's paper, which will very soon be accepted by ApJ (referee report was positive and has been responded to).

 Slide from Courney Dressing's press announcement showing the amount of "sun light" received by the planets around Kepler's red dwarfs. The locations of Mars, Earth, Venus and Mercury are shown along the top. Three of the planets around Kepler's red dwarfs are squarely in the "goldilocks zone".
Have done several of these types of press conferences over the past couple of years, I've started recognizing a pattern in the Q&A with the press. It goes a little something like this:

Astronomers: 6% of M dwarfs have Earth-sized planets in the HZ! (out of breath from all the hard work)
Reporters: But come on, can life really emerge on planets around M dwarfs?! What about flares and tidal locking and bears, oh my? (Ed. note: Okay, I added that third problem)
Astronomers: Ummmm...did we mention all the Earth-sized planets we found with temperate equilibrium temperatures?

First, I'll admit that it's the fault of astronomers for playing it fast and loose with the term "habitable" in reference to the locations of certain planets around other stars. The habitable zone is an extremely idealized concept referring to the region around stars where the incident sun light results in planetary temperatures that would be like the Earth's. But this is under the assumption that the planet has an Earth-like orbit (low eccentricity), an Earth-like atmosphere (albedo), and a nice solid surface where liquid water could pool into lakes and oceans and the like. So reporters are correct to be skeptical.

Thus, when an astronomer says "habitable zone," there's no reason to conclude that the planet is inhabited, or that it even could be inhabited (despite what some astronomers believe). Instead, when you hear the term you should think "possible location around the star where, if a myriad set of conditions are just right, a planet could have liquid water on the surface." Habitable zone is just much easier to say. Also, the habitable zone is something that is easy to calculate based on the parameters of planets discovered by various techniques. We bag 'em, the astrobiologists tag 'em...er...to help us understand whether they could truly be habitable.

So my first point is for the astronomers. We need to be more nuanced when tossing around notions of habitability. My second point is to the reporters. The question "Are these planets truly habitable" is pretty much impossible to answer right now. Why? Because we don't even know the conditions for habitability on our own planet! Here's a long, yet incomplete list of factors/questions that may or may not be important for the emergence of life on Earth:
• Our Moon maintains the Earth's moderate obliquity (axial tilt). Mars undergoes large obliquity swings because it has no moon, which wreaks havoc with its weather
• We have plate tectonics to maintain a carbon-silicate cycle, which keeps CO2 in a stable equilibrium. Maybe. We think.
• If plate tectonics are necessary, is the high water content of Earth's mantle necessary for plate tectonics?
• If the Earth formed "dry" then how was water delivered?
• Do we need a large ocean to maintain thermal inertia?
• Is it important that we have just the right amount of water so as to not cover all landforms?
• Is dry land necessary?
• Is Jupiter a friend or foe? Does it hoover up comets or toss asteroids in?
• Why do we have a hydrogen-poor atmosphere?
• Is water the only suitable solvent for life?
• Is it important that we lack a close stellar binary companion despite ~50% binarity of stars Galaxy-wide?
• Do we need an especially "calm" sun?
• Do we need a low eccentricity?
• Earth is not too large as to have ended up as a mini-Neptune
• Earth is not too small to end up like Mars with high atmospheric escape
• What about Milankovitch cycles?
• Do we need our nickel-iron core for magnetic field generation?
This is just a partial list that I was able to come up with while Google chatting with Prof. Jason Wright. What did we forget?

Andrew Howard said…
Great post and congratulations especially to Courtney!

A word of caution about over-restricting the habitable zone with "rare-Earth" reasoning (requiring too many specific characteristics of the Earth). On this point I particularly like excerpt below from Chyba & Hand, 2005, Annual Reviews of Astronomy & Astrophysics, 43, 31

"A second example of “rare-Earth” reasoning concerns conclusions drawn from the important discovery of the obliquity-stabilizing effect of Earth’s Moon (Laskar & Robutel 1993; Laskar, Joutel & Robutel 1993). The inference is made (Ward & Brownlee 2000, Gonzalez & Richards 2004) that complex life must therefore be rare, on the grounds of the assertion that Earths with Moon-size satellites must be rare, and that in the Moon’s absence wild obliquity fluctuations would occur that would render the environment too inconstant for the evolution of complex or intelligent life. [There is now observational evidence that large planetesimal collisions in other solar systems are common at the end of planetary accretion (Rieke et al. 2005), but, of course, there are currently no statistical data about the frequency or nature of planet–moon combinations that may result.]

But again one must ask what Earth may have been like had the Moon never formed—not what the Earth would look like if today one somehow plucked away the Moon. Laskar & Robutel (1993) show that Moonless Earths rotating with periods <12 hr may be stable against chaotic obliquity fluctuations for a large range of obliquity angles. Of course the current Earth’s period is 24 hr, so if we pluck away the Moon today chaos sets in. But if the Moon had never formed, what would Earth’s rotational velocity have been? A simple angular momentum conservation calculation shows that if one tidally evolves the lunar orbit back in time from its current position at 60 R⊕ to an early orbit at 10 R⊕, Earth’s day would have been about 7 hr long, giving an Earth likely stable against chaotic obliquity fluctuations. Touma’s (2000) simulations of the Earth–Moon system take Earth’s initial rotation period to be 5.0 hr, with the Moon at 3.5 R⊕. Of course, this does not demonstrate that Earth’s rotational period would have been this short had the Moon never formed; it is difficult to estimate Earth’s primordial rotation in the absence of the putative Moon-forming impact [see Lissauer, Dones & Ohtsuki (2000) for a discussion of the issues]. But it shows the arbitrary nature of reaching conclusions about Earth’s rarity by plucking away the Moon today, rather than, say, shortly after lunar formation."

It is important to distinguish between what is habitable for complex versus microbial life. For Earth-like life at least, those two conditions are very different and it’s difficult to say how evolution would adapt to different conditions. Most of the factors in this list wouldn't be relevant for microbial life even on Earth if those things were changed today.

The moon - may not be a deal breaker as Andrew points out. Jupiter as you mentioned is probably neutral since it both protects us and throws stuff in. Size of the planet matters in that we assume currently you need a solid surface. Plate tectonics – probably useful to have a cycle for long term climate stability, but life could arise for the some time without it since we have evidence for life very quickly after Earth cooled. Norm Sleep has many papers on this and here is a great conversation he has about these things, including land fraction coverage and habitability in general (http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/palebluedot/discussions/session2/sleep/default.html & https://pangea.stanford.edu/departments/geophysics/nspapers.html). Ray Pierrehumbert estimates as long as there is 10% surface fraction of water you will have similar climate and climate cycling as Earth. A recent paper by Abbot et al. (2012) also claims that the surface fraction of water doesn't have a large effect on habitability. Activity of star - if the life is under water or ground this doesn't matter at all, and it's unclear whether it would be harmful since there are examples even of animal life on Earth which have high radiation tolerances. Is water the only solvent - Steve Benner would say no (Benner et al., 2004), though water is very abundant compared to some of the other proposed solvents! Low eccentricity - depends on how much time it spends in the HZ (Dressing et al. 2010) and probably extremophiles would do better than complex life. Magnetic field - probably helpful, but less important for life sheltered under water or a layer of soil. Hydrogen in the atmosphere I've not really heard of as being relevant for life other than extending the habitable zone outwards. Binaries - I think the main problem is stability of orbits but if the binary is wide enough this isn't an issue (Eggl 2012, Kaltenegger & Haghighipour 2013).

In the end I think you hit on a very important point. Just because a planet is habitable doesn't mean that the planet is "100% likely to have life. Like you said, we just don't know until we have more information about the planetary context. The only way we'll begin to answer these questions is by detecting biomarkers in the atmospheres of a variety (or lack thereof) of planets and exploring other habitable environments up close in our own solar system like on Titan, Mars, Europa and Enceladus. It's also useful I think to note that this notion of a habitable zone around other stars only is relevant for remote detectability of features in the atmosphere. Europa in our own solar system is a prime example of a habitable environment that we would never detect in another star system since there is no interaction between the life and that atmosphere. Furthermore life built on a different biochemistry would have different signatures that currently are hard to predict and unambiguously distinguish as coming from life. So the HZ concept doesn't mean that's the only place life could be, just that since we know life on Earth uses liquid water, it's the best first place to start. Even Earth-type life could thrive in protected environments far outside the traditional HZ such as in Europa.

One thing that you didn't mention on your list but could be important and is observable is the C/O ratio. If there is more carbon than oxygen the O would be taken up by CO and CO2 and then there would be none left to form silicates. SiC would take the role of silicates and they are very durable and unlikely to weather, making a climate cycle unlikely (Kuchner & Seager 2005).

Those are just some of my thoughts! Great post! :)

### On the Height of J.J. Barea

Dallas Mavericks point guard J.J. Barea standing between two very tall people (from: Picassa user photoasisphoto).

Congrats to the Dallas Mavericks, who beat the Miami Heat tonight in game six to win the NBA championship.

Okay, with that out of the way, just how tall is the busy-footed Maverick point guard J.J. Barea? He's listed as 6-foot on NBA.com, but no one, not even the sports casters, believes that he can possibly be that tall. He looks like a super-fast Hobbit out there. But could that just be relative scaling, with him standing next to a bunch of extremely tall people? People on Yahoo! Answers think so---I know because I've been Google searching "J.J. Barea Height" for the past 15 minutes.

So I decided to find a photo and settle the issue once and for all.

I started by downloading a stock photo of J.J. from NBA.com, which I then loaded into OpenOffice Draw:

I then used the basketball as my metric. Wikipedia states that an NBA basketball is 29.5 inches in circumfe…

### Finding Blissful Clarity by Tuning Out

It's been a minute since I've posted here. My last post was back in April, so it has actually been something like 193,000 minutes, but I like how the kids say "it's been a minute," so I'll stick with that.
As I've said before, I use this space to work out the truths in my life. Writing is a valuable way of taking the non-linear jumble of thoughts in my head and linearizing them by putting them down on the page. In short, writing helps me figure things out. However, logical thinking is not the only way of knowing the world. Another way is to recognize, listen to, and trust one's emotions. Yes, emotions are important for figuring things out.
Back in April, when I last posted here, my emotions were largely characterized by fear, sadness, anger, frustration, confusion and despair. I say largely, because this is what I was feeling on large scales; the world outside of my immediate influence. On smaller scales, where my wife, children and friends reside, I…

### The Force is strong with this one...

Last night we were reviewing multiplication tables with Owen. The family fired off doublets of numbers and Owen confidently multiplied away. In the middle of the review Owen stopped and said, "I noticed something. 2 times 2 is 4. If you subtract 1 it's 3. That's equal to taking 2 and adding 1, and then taking 2 and subtracting 1, and multiplying. So 1 times 3 is 2 times 2 minus 1."

I have to admit, that I didn't quite get it at first. I asked him to repeat with another number and he did with six: "6 times 6 is 36. 36 minus 1 is 35. That's the same as 6-1 times 6+1, which is 35."

Ummmmm....wait. Huh? Lemme see...oh. OH! WOW! Owen figured out

x^2 - 1 = (x - 1) (x +1)

So $6 \times 8 = 7 \times 7 - 1 = (7-1) (7+1) = 48$. That's actually pretty handy!

You can see it in the image above. Look at the elements perpendicular to the diagonal. There's 48 bracketing 49, 35 bracketing 36, etc... After a bit more thought we…

The NIDCD award will provide $300,000 over the next three years to fund the project, titled “Auditory masking effects on speech fluency in aphasia and apraxia of speech.”
In many adults who survive stroke, damage to speech regions of the brain results in a distorted, effortful, and halting pattern of speech, a condition called apraxia of speech. Although they know what they want to say and have intact muscle strength, they have difficulty programming the movements for speech. They are able to hear their speech errors, and the typical treatment program focuses on identifying these errors and correcting them. For most people, focusing on these mistakes results in little improvement in their speech.
In contrast to conventional treatment approaches, Dr. Jacks and his colleagues (Katarina Haley, PhD, DAHS, DSHS; Heidi Roth, MD, Department of Neurology) are studying the effects of preventing the person with apraxia of speech from hearing the errors in their speech, by playing loud noise through earphones. This approach is based on the premise that people with this speech disorder are overly-attuned to speech errors, which prevents them from speaking fluently. The same phenomenon has been known for decades to help people who stutter to speak fluently, as demonstrated in the popular film The King's Speech.
In the proposed research, Dr. Jacks and his colleagues seek to identify stroke survivors who respond positively to listening to noise by increasing speech rate and decreasing the occurrence of speech disfluencies (pauses, filler words, repetitions). Since not all people are expected to show a change in speech while listening to noise, the team also will study individual characteristics to determine what differentiates those who improve from those who do not. In particular, behavioral profiles (type of speech and language impairment) and location and size of brain lesion will be compared between positive responders and non-responders to determine whether a positive response can be predicted from routine clinical data.
In preliminary work, over half of the participants tested spoke more quickly and with fewer disfluencies while listening to noise. Although this is a temporary effect and does not persist after the noise is turned off, the moments of speech fluency experienced may cause the person's brain to activate in a different way than it does when he or she is speaking disfluently. If the preliminary results are borne out in the completed study, Dr. Jacks and his team believe that the procedure may be further developed into a useful therapeutic technique that can result in lasting speech changes.

# OPERATION RAGDOLL // Swat Soldiers New toy!

Hey gang !

I have couple of ideas to play around with these guys…!
I am planning to implement some MOCAP- FIELDS to create explosions and smash reactions… we will see how it goes!

First Round: “Operation RAGDOLL”

• Set up the RAGDOLL
• Play with values

MOCAP vs Ragdoll secondary details. (Animation has NOT been baked into the RIG yet)

At first I could not see the difference It’s subtle, but that last fall onto the ground got a really nice upgrade compared to the motion capture, which is somewhat exaggerated. Especially the legs bouncing up towards the end, and the immediate lack of motion at the end of its animation clip. These deserve some close-ups, with shadows to highlight the contacts.

Hey Marcus !
Agreed… ! some upgrades from the RG simulation

my idea is to create a more dynamic scene, I want to see if now that I have set up the RG, I can reference this file couple of times and create a shot more interesting where the soldiers interact and react to Fields, columns and stuff like that !

Will keep the WIP posted !

Testing and learning some Fields…!

It is tricky ! … the visual representation of the fields and the amount of "magnitude that needs to be enter, takes times…
But it is really fun to play with !

Very nice! What was the most tricky aspect you found? Cranking up Magnitude? It’s been difficult finding a good default, since every character has a different size and weight. For very heavy things, you need more magnitude. I’ve considered making it such that the size and weight of objects are ignored, such that the defaults make sense for everything. It would be less realistic, and it would not look natural when there are multiple different sizes of objects within the same field; but perhaps it would be easier to work with?

For feedback, there’s a part where lands at the end that looks like a wooden puppet landing on a marble floor, because the contacts are so hard. I would make both of those environment boxes Dynamic and Pin them in worldspace, such that they are somewhat soft. I’d probably split up the long box into a few smaller boxes, so that the whole thing isn’t moving as one. That would make the landing a bit more soft and possibly more realistic.

Hey Marcus !

here’s my 10 cents “feedback”

1- “Magnitude” Yes… hard to crank it… as an idea… Would be nice to have the Scale attr, as we have on the solver… Where we can X10 X100 the value… so the values are not that crazy on the the GraphEditor

2- Direction vector and visualization vector : When the “Gizmo” (Sphere, box, none etc) it is really hard to guess where the direction is going. Specially with “newton” and Radial was more friendly but still… I guess and icon “Like for example” Direct Lights from Maya has will help. The Size of the icon could also be connected to the Attr that scales x10 - x100 the magnitude.

3- I did try to use “two” (2) Radial forces, but even when one of them were set to ZERO, it seems it was + “adding” force to the vector… So I decided to use just one and animate the position of the Gizmo

Thanks for your feedback… it will help ! I will keep playing around with this…
My idea is to use more that three Soldiers doing different actions from MOCAP Lib (idle - Walking - running) and give the some Big burst to make them blow away !

Awesome stuff.

Sorry about that, there is a fix here:

There is not, but there are ways to make videos smaller. Maya does a terrible job compressing video.

Here’s your 6.94 mb file with much better compression, at 0.40 mb, quality is near identical.

For this, I use FFMPEG and there’s also Handbreak which is free and has a nice UI. You’d playblast, and then drop your video in here.

If you’re a techie, you can use ffmpeg and the command-line with this .bat script.

# General¶

## Overview¶

With enhavo you are able to set global values for your storage and strategy. Additionally you can define these values for every newsletter subscription form individually. You are able to set one or more group for every subscriber globally and add additional groups per subscription form.

## Default Storage Type¶

The default storage type is applied to every subscription form on your site if you don’t override it. There are currently two storage types - ‘local’ and ‘cleverreach’. ‘local’ is the default value - you need no entry in your app/config/enhavo.yml. If you want to use Clever Reach, put the following statement in your app/config/enhavo.yml and follow the instructions in the Clever Reach Configuration help file.

enhavo_newsletter:
storage:
default: cleverreach


## Default Groups¶

You can associate subscribers with groups. This is mandatory for Clever Reach and optional for the local storage. To set default groups use the following example

enhavo_newsletter:
storage:
groups:
defaults:
- group1
- group2
- ..


## Default Strategy¶

There are currently 3 different subscription strategies: notify, accept and double_opt_in. The default strategy is notify - you don’t need to add the following statement if you want to use it. To set another default strategy use this statement

enhavo_newsletter:
strategy:
default: double_opt_in


## Individual Form Settings¶

You are able to override the default settings for storage, strategy and groups for every individual form. Also you can define the type and template individually. Do it as follows

enhavo_newsletter:
forms:
<form_name>:
default_groups:
- 'code_of_group3'
storage:
type: local
strategy:
type: accept

Interesting, I'd like to know more about this.
Unsurprising, considering the Neolithic Revolution occurred around 10,000 years ago. Up until that point, lactase production stopped once individuals surpassed the weaning age and were no longer drinking milk. Domestication of cattle, goats and camels allowed neolithic humans to continue to drink milk without having to suck on their mothers teats their entire lives. So lactase (the enzyme that breaks lactose into glucose and galactose) production continued into adulthood. Lactose intolerance by population of people correlates with the access to domesticated mammals that neolithic humans living in that area had.

Request to add a [bed leveling] tag
There are currently about 50 questions containing the words “leveling” or “levelling”. I think it would be helpful to unify them with a tag, but I can't find an appropriate one. Further, several of these questions are tagged with [heated-bed] without being about heating, which is somewhat misleading.
Bed leveling is an area in which one may accrue distinct expertise, and as such I would like to suggest a [bed-leveling] tag to help experts find and answer questions. The spelling with a single “l” is the more common spelling used on the site and also that used in Marlin's documentation. The tag's ambit could encompass:

Mechanical bed-leveling such as manual adjustment of screws and springs
Software bed-leveling like the G29 G-Code command
General Z-axis measurement with a mechanical or inductive probe

The tag could also be applied post-facto to questions about printing problems like poor-adhesion, should the solution be found to involve bed calibration.

There is no tag created for leveling (or levelling, or bed-leveling for that matter). So, I would recommend taking some of your top search results for leveling, of your results, if any have available tags (not all 5 tags have been used) then add/created the [bed-leveling] tag.
Overall, this is a good catch on potentially improving the tagging here on 3DPrinting SE.

I cannot add tags or edit questions yet, but if you could create the tag I would be happy to make edit suggestions, starting with any posts that would also benefit from grammar or formatting help.

@IanMackinnon I just added the bed-leveling tag, so it should be available now. Happy editing! :)

As confirmed by this comment under the other answer, there is now a bed-leveling tag, so this meta question should now be marked as:

I’ve just watched the last instalment of Dan Snow’s latest series.
After Trafalgar the Royal Navy was riding the crest of a wave. Dominant in all of the world’s oceans, the ironclad era and the advent of engine propulsion spurred it on to new heights.
But away from the ships, a sea change too place in the culture of those who served in the Royal Navy. Whilst still worshipping the memory of Nelson, officers began to place obedience far above initiative – the value that Nelson had tried to instill among his Captains. As the Navy became the darling of British society, it also became more stratified socially, which stifled meritocracy.
One man in the early Twentieth Century tried to change all of this. Admiral Jackie Fisher became First Sea Lord with a comprehensive plan to modernise all aspects of the Royal Navy. His mantra was ‘if you want peace, prepare for war’ – put simply, he wanted to make the Royal Navy so large and so powerful, that no-one would dare challenge it. Soon 25% of all Government expenditure was being spent on the Navy.
Chief among this spending was the new Class of Battleship – the Dreadnought. Far better armed and armoured than any ship previously, she rendered all other ships virtually obsolete. An arms race developed in Europe, with the Kaiser’s Germany attempting to challenge British Naval supremacy.
Although the German Navy had less than half the amount of Dreadnoughts as Britain, in 1916 the German fleet attempted to draw the British Grand Fleet into battle. Although the Grand Fleet suffered heavy losses at Jutland, the battle was a strategic victory for the British – the sheer amount of ships flying the white ensign prevented the Germans from challenging them again. The British failings at Jutland had been caused by a slowness to adapt to the new technology of battle – poor communications combined with rigid obedience led to ships failing to act decisively, and un-necessary losses.
Although Jutland led to bursting of the 100 year ‘Trafagar bubble’, it also shook the Royal Navy out of its complacency. Never the less, after the First World War Britain was no longer the world’s dominant Naval power.
This episode ends the series nicely, but I do feel that it concludes very abruptly. British Naval power did not suddenly end after 1918 – the size of the Royal Navy in 1940 still prevented Nazi Germany from invading Britain. I would argue that it was through the symbolic loss of the Royal Oak, the Hood, Prince of Wales and Renown that Britain really lost her naval superpower status. The decline may have begun at Jutland, but it was only in the latter stages of the Second World War that the US Navy eclipsed the Royal Navy.
All in all, this has been a thought-provoking series that has discussed a key part of British history. I have been impressed with how well Dan Snow has put across some complicated ideas in very simple and understandable ways. Many of them are extremely relevant today. On the down side, perhaps it did ignore earlier and later factors outside of the series arbitrary start and end dates. An earlier episode on Tudor sea power and a later one on the Second World War would have made much more sense.
How about a similar series, looking at the British Army since Cromwell?

Happy Easter, Happy Passover, and Happy Cherry Blossom Time! I hope you are having a joyous spring!
Native to Japan, the Yoshino cherry (Prunus x yedoensis) is cultivated extensively and is also found growing wild on plains and mountains countrywide. For more than ten centuries, and continuing with no less enthusiasm today, cherry blossom time has been cause for joyful celebration that is deeply integrated in the Japanese culture.
Cherry blossoms, cherry blossoms
As far as you can see.
Across yayoi skies
Is it mist? Is it clouds?
Ah, the fragrance!
Let us go, Let us go and see!
To see a cherry blossom snowstorm:
In the Japanese language the cherry is called “sakura,” which is generally believed to be a corruption of the word “sukuya” (blooming). Poets and artists strive to express the loveliness of its flowers in words and artistry. Called the flower of flowers, when the Japanese use the word “hane” (flower) it has come to mean sakura, and no other flower. Since the Heian period “hanami” has referred to cherry blossom viewing; the term was used to describe cherry blossom parties in the Tale of Gengi. Aristocrats wrote poetry and sang songs under the flowering trees for celebratory flower viewing parties. The custom soon spread to the samurai society and by the Edo period, hanami was celebrated by all people.
From ancient times, during early spring planting rituals, falling blossoms symbolized a bounteous crop of rice. Beginning with the Heian period (794–1185), when the imperial courtiers of Kyoto held power, the preference for graceful beauty and the appreciation of cherry blossoms for beauty’s sake began to evolve. The way in which cherry petals fall at the height of their beauty, before they have withered and become unsightly, and the transience of their brief period of blooming, assumed symbolism in Buddhism and the samurai warrior code.
The delicacy and transience of the cherry blossom have poignant and poetic appeal, providing themes for songs and poems since the earliest times. The motif of the five petal cherry blossoms is used extensively for decorative arts designs, including kimonos, works in enamel, pottery, and lacquer ware. Cherry tree wood is valued for its tight grain and is a lustrous reddish brown when polished. The wood is used to make furniture, trays, seals, checkerboards, and woodblocks for producing color wood block prints.
In modern times the advent of the cherry blossom season not only heralds the coming of spring, but is also the beginning of the new school year and the new fiscal year for businesses. Today families and friends gather under the blooms and celebrate with picnicking, drinking, and singing. The fleeting beauty of the blossoms, scattering just a few days after flowering, is a reminder to take time to appreciate life. In the evening when the sun goes down, viewing the pale-colored cherry blossoms silhouetted against the night sky is considered an added pleasure of the season.
The tradition of celebrating cherry blossom season began in the United States when, on Valentine’s Day in 1912, Tokyo mayor Yukio Okaki gave the city of Washington, D.C., 3,000 of twelve different varieties of cherry trees as an act of friendship. First Lady Helen Taft and the wife of the Japanese ambassador, Viscountess Chinda, planted the initial two of these first cherry trees in Potomac Park. Today cherry blossom festivals are celebrated annually not only in Wash- ington, D.C., but in Brooklyn, San Francisco, Seattle, and Macon, Georgia.
It is said that the true lover of cherry blossoms considers the season is at its height when the buds are little more than half open—for when the blossoms are fully opened there is already the intimation of their decline.

I’m working on a website for a rafting non-profit. I thought it would be cool if they could display the flow data for local rivers. I also thought this would be good time for me to learn more about D3js and the USGS instantaneous flow data API.

900cfs

## Dolores River

At Dolores, CO

For the design, I need to accomplish a few customizations of a standard line chart.

1. I wanted to use fetch to get the data using the USGS instantaneous flow data API and plot the received data on the fly.
2. The chart needs to be responsive.
3. I wanted to plot an area chart instead of a line chart.
4. I wanted to plot the tick marks inside of the chart instead of in the margins for a nice looking design.

I’ll break everythin down below. If you are just here for the JS scripts, here they are.

<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js"></script>

<script>
flowChart();
async function flowChart(){
let waterUrl = "https://nwis.waterservices.usgs.gov/nwis/iv/?format=json&sites=09166500&startDT=2020-04-27&endDT=2020-05-03&parameterCd=00060&siteStatus=all"

let timeFormat = d3.timeFormat("%m-%d-%Y %H");
//Call the api
const response = await fetch(waterUrl);
const jsonData = await response.json();
console.log(jsonData)

//Parse the data returned from api
let sites = jsonData.value.timeSeries[0];
let riverName = sites.sourceInfo.siteName.toLowerCase().split(/ at | near /);
let flowData = sites.values[0].value.map(({dateTime, value})=>({date:new Date(dateTime), value:parseFloat(value)}));

//build chart

// set the dimensions and margins of the graph
let margin = {top: 10, right: 30, bottom: 30, left: 50},
width = 600 - margin.right-margin.left,
height = 400 - margin.top - margin.bottom;

// append the svg object to the body of the page
let svg = d3.select("#my_dataviz")
.append("svg")
.attr("preserveAspectRatio", "xMinYMin meet")
.attr("viewBox", "0 0 " +(width) + " " + (height))
.append("g")
.attr("transform",
"translate(0 ,0)");
let x = d3.scaleTime()
.domain(d3.extent(flowData, function(d){return d.date}))
.range([0,width]);
svg.append("g")
.attr("transform", "translate("+margin.right+","+(height-margin.bottom)+")")
.attr("stroke-width", "0")
.call(d3.axisBottom(x)
.ticks(d3.timeDay.every(1)));

let y = d3.scaleLinear()
.domain([0, (d3.max(flowData, function(d) { return +d.value; })*1.2)])
.range([height, 0]);
svg.append("g")
.attr("transform", "translate(40, 0)")
.attr("stroke-width", "0")
.attr("class", "x-axis")
.call(d3.axisLeft(y)
.ticks(5))

svg.append("path")
.datum(flowData)
.attr("fill", "#FF5722")
.attr("stroke", 'none')
.attr("opacity", "0.45")
.attr('d', d3.area()
.x(function(d){return x(d.date)})
.y0(y(0))
.y1(function(d){return y(d.value)})
)
}

</script>


## Fetching the data and making it usable.

The first steps in plotting any chart is getting data. In this case we will be pulling river flow data for 7 days for my home town river, the Dolores River. I used the USGS API generator to generate a URL to pull data for seven days over the summer.

https://nwis.waterservices.usgs.gov/nwis/iv/?format=json&sites=09166500&startDT=2019-07-09&endDT=2019-07-16&parameterCd=00060&siteStatus=all


There are two ways to use fetch: I prefer calling fetch inside of an asynchronous function. I don’t know why, but this method seems to make more sense to me.

<script>
flowChart();
async function flowChart(){
let waterUrl = "https://nwis.waterservices.usgs.gov/nwis/iv/?format=json&sites=09166500&startDT=2020-04-27&endDT=2020-05-03&parameterCd=00060&siteStatus=all"

//Call the api
const response = await fetch(waterUrl);
const jsonData = await response.json();
console.log(jsonData)
}
</script>


Let’s break this down:

1. flowChart(); calls the async function.
2. async function flowChart(){} sets us up to write a async function called flowChart() which has already been called.
3. let waterUrl assigns the API url to a variable to be used in the next step.
4. const response = await fetch(waterUrl); fetches the data from the API. await is used here to wait until the data has been returned to assign the data to the variable.
5. Similarly const jsonData = await response.json(); waits for the response to be to be converted to json with .json() and then assigned to the variable.

The result should be json data that includes the stream flow data that we want to plot in a timeseries along with a bunch of other information that the API provides. Consoled out — console.log(jsonData) — the beginning of the data should look like this:

{
"name": "ns1:timeSeriesResponseType",
"declaredType": "org.cuahsi.waterml.TimeSeriesResponseType",
"scope": "javax.xml.bind.JAXBElement\$GlobalScope",
"value": {
"queryInfo": {
"queryURL": "http://nwis.waterservices.usgs.gov/nwis/iv/format=json&sites=09166500&startDT=2019-07-09&endDT=2019-07-16&parameterCd=00060&siteStatus=all",
"criteria": {
"locationParam": "[ALL:09166500]",
"variableParam": "[00060]",
"timeParam": {
"beginDateTime": "2019-07-09T00:00:00.000",
"endDateTime": "2019-07-16T23:59:59.000"
},
"parameter": []
},
"note": [
{
"value": "[ALL:09166500]",
"title": "filter:sites"
},
{
"value": "[mode=RANGE, modifiedSince=null] interval={INTERVAL[2019-07-09T00:00:00.000-04:00/2019-07-16T23:59:59.000Z]}",
"title": "filter:timeRange"
}, //....way more json below
}
}
}



Next we will parse the incoming data.

<script>
flowChart();
async function flowChart(){
let waterUrl = "https://nwis.waterservices.usgs.gov/nwis/iv/?format=json&sites=09166500&startDT=2019-07-09&endDT=2019-07-16&parameterCd=00060&siteStatus=all"

//Call the api
const response = await fetch(waterUrl);
const jsonData = await response.json();
console.log(jsonData)

//Parse the data returned from api
let sites = jsonData.value.timeSeries[0];
let flowData = sites.values[0].value.map(({dateTime, value})=>({date:new Date(dateTime), value:parseFloat(value)}));
}
</script>

1. The let sites = jsonData.value.timeSeries[0]; first we create a variable site that will be the base for the rest of the parsing. Within the jsonData variable, we go to value, then timeseries[0]. I did this because I may call more than one river at a time for my application. You can skip this step if you want by pasting jsonData.value.timeSeries[0] in place of sites in the next step.
2. The next step we’ll break down. First we parse down to the time series value data sites.values[0].value. Then we use the .map() function to convert the dateTime variable, and the value variable to an array with a date formatted date column and a numerical value column. We assign the result to a flowData function. The result should look like so: let flowData = sites.values[0].value.map(({dateTime, value})=>({date:new Date(dateTime), value:parseFloat(value)}));

Now we have our usable data we need to use D3 to chart the data.

## Making a Responsive Chart

let svg = d3.select("#my_dataviz")
.append("svg")
.attr("preserveAspectRatio", "xMinYMin meet")
.attr("viewBox", "0 0 " +(width) + " " + (height))
.append("g")
.attr("transform",
"translate(0 ,0)");


The key here is many examples give the chart a height and a width. Examples also usually use some fancy javascript to check the height and the width of the window and then reset the size of the chart to make it responsive. A simple way to convert a plain chart to a responsive chart is to set the viewBox attribute — instead of a hard coded height and width — .attr("viewBox", "0 0 " +(width) + " " + (height)) and preserve the aspect ratio .attr("preserveAspectRatio", "xMinYMin meet").

## Area chart instead of a line chart

svg.append("path")
.datum(flowData)
//some other .attr
.attr('d', d3.area()
.x(function(d){return x(d.date)})
.y0(y(0))
.y1(function(d){return y(d.value)})
)


To plot an area chart you replace .attr('d', d3.line()) with .attr('d', d3.area()) and provide two y values, one for the upper bound of the area chart and one for the bottom (usually 0), instead of one. The x value stays the same as it would for any line chart.

## Plotting the tick marks inside the chart.

This one was tricky for me. For whatever reason I couldn’t figure out how to make the axis have less of a width than the chart. But really that is all you need to do is make the length or width of the axis smaller than the chart. You have to be a little careful though because you want the ticks to line up appropriately with the data.

To understand this let’s first look at the base chart.

// set the dimensions and margins of the graph
let margin = {top: 10, right: 30, bottom: 30, left: 50},
width = 600,
height = 400;

// append the svg object to the body of the page
let svg = d3.select("#my_dataviz")
.append("svg")
.attr("preserveAspectRatio", "xMinYMin meet")
.attr("viewBox", "0 0 " +width + " " + height);


As we looked at above we have a svg that is appended to a <div> with a id of #my_dataviz that we set a viewBox attribute on of "0 0" + width + " "+ height + ". Typically, we would set the width and the height to some value minus margins. The margins allow for axis marks outside of the chart. But in this case we want the axis marks to be inside of the chart. So the widths do not subtract the margins.

Next we create the x-axis and append that to the svg.

// set the dimensions and margins of the graph
let margin = {top: 10, right: 30, bottom: 30, left: 50},
width = 600,
height = 400;

// append the svg object to the body of the page
let svg = d3.select("#my_dataviz")
.append("svg")
.attr("preserveAspectRatio", "xMinYMin meet")
.attr("viewBox", "0 0 " +width + " " + height);

let x = d3.scaleTime()
.domain(d3.extent(flowData, function(d){return d.date}))
.range([0,width]);
svg.append("g")
.attr("transform", "translate(0,"+(height-margin.bottom)+")")
.attr("stroke-width", "0")
.call(d3.axisBottom(x)
.ticks(d3.timeDay.every(1)));


We give the x-axis a domain of the flowData, date and a range of the entire width of the chart. We append the axis an <g> element within the svg. We then want to transform the with a .attr to put the axis in place. The difference here from your standard chart is that we need to translate along the y-axis by the height-margin.bottom instead of just the height like you would in a standard plot with the axis below the chart. Subtracting the margin pulls the axis from below the chart (not visible because it is outside of the svg) to within the chart.

The last step is to plot the y-axis.

//build chart

// set the dimensions and margins of the graph
let margin = {top: 10, right: 40, bottom: 30, left: 50},
width = 600,
height = 400;

// append the svg object to the body of the page
let svg = d3.select("#my_dataviz")
.append("svg")
.attr("preserveAspectRatio", "xMinYMin meet")
.attr("viewBox", "0 0 " +width + " " + height)

let x = d3.scaleTime()
.domain(d3.extent(flowData, function(d){return d.date}))
.range([0,width]);
svg.append("g")
.attr("transform", "translate(0,"+(height-margin.bottom)+")")
.attr("stroke-width", "0")
.attr("class", "x-axis")
.call(d3.axisBottom(x)
.ticks(d3.timeDay.every(1)));

let y = d3.scaleLinear()
.domain([0, (d3.max(flowData, function(d) { return +d.value; })*1.2)])
.range([height, 0]);
svg.append("g")
.attr("transform", "translate(" + margin.right + ", 0)")
.attr("stroke-width", "0")
.attr("class", "y-axis")
.call(d3.axisLeft(y)
.ticks(5))


This time we will use d3.scaleLinear because the actual flow volumes are continuous. Domain and Range are similar to above, but I multiply the max of the values by 1.2 because I want some space within the plot for a title. After we append the element we translate by margin.right, to move the axis within the chart.

## The HTML and CSS:

The rest of the chart is completed by css and some html. Some imortant things happen here. We hide some of the axis marks because having them inside the chart creates overlap between the x and y-axis. We also style the associated info. Ideally the html for the info would be automatically generated by the chart, but that is a bit much form one tutorial.

The non JS stuff looks like so:

<script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js"></script>

In digital imaging, there are 256 levels, or tonal values, ranging from black to white. Black is level 0. White is level 255. Of course, not all images (e.g. extreme foggy, misty, atmospheric shots) contain the full tonal range from black to white, but most do.
The histogram (Levels) is a graphical representation of the tonal values in an image. Ideally, it should range from 0 to 255, with a good spread of tonal values throughout.
If the histogram is bunched up towards the left, it indicates the image is under-exposed. Note the crushed shadow detail.
If bunched up towards the right, it's over exposed. Note the blown-out highlights.
If the black and white points are set incorrectly, the image will have a dull, flat, washed-out appearance. Here they're wrongly set to 20/230.
Unless under instructions from a repro bureau or printer, you should not set the black/white points to anything other than 0/255. The printer may well adjust them later for technical reasons to do with repro, but don't try to guess what's required. It's true that some leeway is acceptable (e.g. up to 5% is usually OK), but your images will lack visual impact if the black/white points are incorrect, so don't do this as a matter of course.
In the vast majority of cases, it's best to set them to 0/255.

Due to the nature of the sport, concussions can occur in water polo. In the injury research study conducted in Athens during the Olympic Games comparing injury incidence in all team sports, it was found that water polo was one of the safest of the team sports with a relative low injury rate. Head injury was the most common injury suffered in water polo. As mentioned in the article by Dr. Drum, there are Guidelines available for the diagnosis and management of concussion (Prague Consensus on Concussion 2004). In answer to your question, any athlete who has symptoms of concussion should not be training or competing. All athletes with concussion symptoms should seek medical attention.

Technology Review has a writeup on the latest advance in the lab towards an invisibility cloak made of metamaterials, described this week in Science. We've been following this technology since the beginning. The breakthrough is software that lets researchers design materials that are both low-loss and wideband. "The cloak that the researchers built works with wavelengths of light ranging from about 1 to 18 gigahertz — a swath as broad as the visible spectrum. No one has yet made a cloaking device that works in the visible spectrum, and those metamaterials that have been fabricated tend to work only with narrow bands of light. But a cloak that made an object invisible to light of only one color would not be of much use. Similarly, a cloaking device can't afford to be lossy: if it lets just a little bit of light reflect off the object it's supposed to cloak, it's no longer effective. The cloak that Smith built is very low loss, successfully rerouting almost all the light that hits it."

A simple, inexpensive method for preventing type 2 diabetes that relies on calling people and educating them on the sort of lifestyle changes they could make to avoid developing the disease has proven effective in a study conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and the City of Berkeley Department of Public Health.
The study involved 230 people in poor, urban neighborhoods in the San Francisco Bay Area cities of Richmond, Oakland and Berkeley. Contacted by phone about once a month, half of them received specific dietary guidance and other lifestyle counseling. After six months, those who had received the counseling had on average lost more weight, were consuming less fat, were eating more fruits and vegetables and showed more improvements in lowering in their blood triglycerides, a key risk measure for type 2 diabetes.
Described this week in the American Journal of Public Health, the new intervention is specifically designed for urban, poor, and predominantly minority communities. It addresses the need for diabetes prevention interventions in these communities and highlights a simple fact that doctors at UCSF and elsewhere have been repeating for years — that type 2 diabetes is preventable in the first place.
“Diabetes is not something you are necessarily going to get just because it runs in your family,” said Alka Kanaya, MD, an associate professor of medicine at UCSF and one of two senior authors on the study. “It is very preventable, and lifestyle changes can really impact the onset of diabetes.”
“You can do something about it,” said Anita Stewart, PhD, a professor at the UCSF Institute for Health & Aging and the Center for Aging in Diverse Communities who is the other senior author on the paper.
How Lifestyle Changes Can Prevent Diabetes
Diabetes is a chronic and complex disease marked by high levels of sugar in the blood that arise due to problems with the hormone insulin, which regulates blood sugar levels. It is usually caused by an inability to produce insulin (type 1) or an inability to respond correctly to insulin (type 2).
A major health concern in the United States, diabetes of all types affect an estimated 8.3 percent of the U.S. population — some 25.8 million Americans — and cost U.S. taxpayers more than $200 billion annually.
In California alone, an estimated 4 million people (one out of every seven adults) have type 2 diabetes and millions more are at risk of developing it. These numbers are poised to explode in the next half century if more is not done to prevent diabetes.
Previous studies have shown that counseling and other lifestyle interventions are effective at preventing type 2 diabetes, but those interventions have generally been designed for clinical settings and include separate sessions with numerous health professionals. This makes them expensive and difficult to scale to large urban populations where diabetes interventions are needed the most.
Many of this country’s urban poor face thin health insurance coverage, low literacy, and low income, and a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes. These disparities were apparent in the UCSF study. About half of the study population was composed of immigrants, and nearly a quarter had no health insurance. Almost a third said they faced financial hardship, and 22 percent had less than a high-school education.
By focusing on a phone-based solution delivered by the Public Health department staff, the UCSF researchers designed their new intervention specifically as a low-cost community-based approach that would be relevant to poor, minority and low-literacy populations. Similar telephone interventions have been used to reach out broadly to populations in San Francisco and in other cities to spread lifestyle messages related to hypertension, smoking, high cholesterol and other issues.
“This adds to our public health toolkit of ways to do outreach and prevent diabetes,” said Kanaya.

Kanaya, Jasmine Santoyo-Olsson, Steven Gregorich, Melanie Grossman, Tanya Moore and Anita L. Stewart appears in the June 14, 2012 issue of the American Journal of Public Health.

What is a kidney stone?
A kidney stone is a solid piece of material that forms in a kidney when substances that are normally found in the urine become highly concentrated. A stone may stay in the kidney or travel down the urinary tract. Kidney stones vary in size. A small stone may pass out of the body causing little or no pain. A larger stone may get stuck along the urinary tract and can block the flow of urine, causing severe pain or blood that can be seen in the urine.
What is the urinary tract?
The urinary tract is the body’s drainage system for removing wastes and extra water. The urinary tract includes two kidneys, two ureters, a bladder, and a urethra. The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist and located below the ribs, one on each side of the spine, toward the middle of the back. Every minute, a person’s kidneys filter about 3 ounces of blood, removing wastes and extra water. The wastes and extra water make up the 1 to 2 quarts of urine an adult produces each day. Children produce less urine each day; the amount produced depends on their age. The urine travels from the kidneys down two narrow tubes called the ureters. The urine is then stored in a balloonlike organ called the bladder. When the bladder empties, urine flows out of the body through a tube called the urethra at the bottom of the bladder.
Are kidney stones common in children?
No exact information about the incidence of kidney stones in children is available, but many kidney specialists report seeing more children with this condition in recent years. While kidney stones are more common in adults, they do occur in infants, children, and teenagers from all races and ethnicities
What causes kidney stones in children?
Kidney stones can form when substances
in the urine—such as calcium, magnesium,
oxalate, and phosphorous—become highly
concentrated due to one or more causes:
- Defects in the urinary tract may block the flow of urine and create pools of urine. In stagnant urine, stone-forming substances tend to settle together into stones. Up to one-third of children who have stones have an anatomic abnormality in their urinary tract.
- Kidney stones may have a genetic cause. In other words, the tendency to form stones can run in families due to inherited factors.
- An unhealthy lifestyle may make children more likely to have kidney stones. For example, drinking too little water or drinking the wrong types of fluids, such as soft drinks or drinks with caffeine, may cause substances in the urine to become too concentrated. Similarly, too much sodium, or salt, in the diet may contribute to more chemicals in the urine, causing an increase in stone formation. Some doctors believe increases in obesity rates, less active lifestyles, and diets higher in salt may be causing more children to have kidney stones.
- Sometimes, a urinary tract infection can cause kidney stones to form. Some types of bacteria in the urinary tract break down urea—a waste product removed from the blood by the kidneys—into substances that form stones.
- Some children have metabolic disorders that lead to kidney stones. Metabolism is the way the body uses digested food for energy, including the process of breaking down food, using food’s nutrients in the body, and removing the wastes that remain. The most common metabolic disorder that causes kidney stones in children is hypercalciuria, which causes extra calcium to collect in the urine. Other more rare metabolic conditions involve problems breaking down oxalate, a substance made in the body and found in some foods. These conditions include hyperoxaluria, too much oxalate in the urine, and oxalosis, characterized by deposits of oxalate and calcium in the body’s tissues. Another rare metabolic condition called cystinuria can cause kidney stones. Cystinuria is an excess of the amino acid cystine in the urine. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.
What are the signs and symptoms of kidney stones in children?
Children with kidney stones may have pain while urinating, see blood in the urine, or feel a sharp pain in the back or lower abdomen. The pain may last for a short or long time. Children may experience nausea and vomiting with the pain. However, children who have small stones that pass easily through the urinary tract may not have symptoms at all.
What types of kidney stones occur in children?
Four major types of kidney stones occur in
- Calcium stones are the most common type of kidney stone and occur in two major forms: calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate. Calcium oxalate stones are more common. Calcium oxalate stone formation has various causes, which may include high calcium excretion, high oxalate excretion, or acidic urine. Calcium phosphate stones are caused by alkaline urine.
- Uric acid stones form when the urine is persistently acidic. A diet rich in purines—substances found in animal proteins such as meats, fish, and shellfish—may cause uric acid. If uric acid becomes concentrated in the urine, it can settle and form a stone by itself or along with calcium.
- Struvite stones result from kidney infections. Eliminating infected stones from the urinary tract and staying infectionfree can prevent more struvite stones.
- Cystine stones result from a genetic disorder that causes cystine to leak through the kidneys and into the urine in high concentration, forming crystals that tend to accumulate into stones.
How are kidney stones in children diagnosed?
The process of diagnosing any illness begins
with consideration of the symptoms. Pain
or bloody urine may be the first symptom.
Urine, blood, and imaging tests will help
determine whether symptoms are caused by
a stone. Urine tests can be used to check
for infection and for substances that form
stones. Blood tests can be used to check for
biochemical problems that can lead to kidney
stones. Various imaging techniques can be
used to locate the stone:
- Ultrasound uses a device, called a transducer, that bounces safe, painless sound waves off organs to create an image of their structure. An abdominal ultrasound can create images of the entire urinary tract. The procedure is performed in a health care provider’s office, outpatient center, or hospital by a specially trained technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist—a doctor who specializes in medical imaging; anesthesia is not needed. The images can show the location of any stones. This test does not expose children to radiation, unlike some other imaging tests. Although other tests are more useful in detecting very small stones or stones in the lower portion of the ureter, ultrasound is considered by many health care providers to be the best screening test to look for stones.
- Computerized tomography (CT) scans use a combination of x rays and computer technology to create threedimensional (3-D) images. A CT scan may include the injection of a special dye, called contrast medium. CT scans require the child to lie on a table that slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the x rays are taken. The procedure is performed in an outpatient center or hospital by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. CT scans may be required to get an accurate stone count when children are being considered for urologic surgery. Because CT scans expose children to a moderate amount of radiation, health care providers try to reduce radiation exposure in children by avoiding repeated CT scans, restricting the area scanned as much as possible, and using the lowest radiation dose that will provide the needed diagnostic information.
- X-ray machines use radiation to create images of the child’s urinary tract. The images can be taken at an outpatient center or hospital by an x-ray technician, and the images are interpreted by a radiologist; anesthesia is not needed. The x rays are used to locate many kinds of stones. A conventional x ray is generally less informative than an ultrasound or CT scan, but it is less expensive and can be done more quickly than other imaging procedures.
How are kidney stones in children treated?
The treatment for a kidney stone usually
depends on its size and what it is made of,
as well as whether it is causing symptoms of
pain or obstructing the urinary tract. Small
stones usually pass through the urinary tract
without treatment. Still, children will often
require pain control and encouragement to
drink lots of fluids to help move the stone
along. Pain control may consist of oral or
intravenous (IV) medication, depending
on the duration and severity of the pain.
IV fluids may be needed if the child becomes
dehydrated from vomiting or an inability to
drink. A child with a larger stone, or one
that blocks urine flow and causes great pain,
may need to be hospitalized for more urgent
treatment. Hospital treatments may include
- Shock wave lithotripsy (SWL). A machine called a lithotripter is used by the doctor to crush the kidney stone. In SWL, the child lies on a table or, less commonly, in a tub of water above the lithotripter. The lithotripter generates shock waves that pass through the child’s body to break the kidney stone into smaller particles to pass more readily through the urinary tract. Children younger than age 12 may receive general anesthesia during the procedure. Older children usually receive an IV sedative and pain medication.
- Removal of the stone with a ureteroscope.
A ureteroscope is a long, tubelike
instrument used to visualize the
urinary tract. After the child receives a
sedative, the doctor inserts the ureteroscope
into the child’s urethra and slides
the scope through the bladder and into
the ureter. Through the ureteroscope,
which has a small basket attached to the
end, the doctor may be able to see and
remove the stone in the ureter.
- Lithotripsy with a ureteroscope.
Another way to treat a kidney stone
through a ureteroscope is to extend a
flexible fiber through the scope up to
the stone. The fiber is attached to a
laser generator. Instead of shock waves,
the fiber delivers a laser beam to break
the stone into smaller pieces that can
pass out of the body in the urine. The
child may receive general anesthesia or
- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy. In this
procedure, a tube is inserted directly
into the kidney through an incision in
the child’s back. Using a wire-thin viewing
instrument called a nephroscope,
the doctor locates and removes the
stone. For large stones, an ultrasonic
probe that acts as a lithotripter may
be needed to deliver shock waves that
break the stone into small pieces that
can be removed more easily. Children
receive general anesthesia for percutaneous
nephrolithotomy. Often, children
stay in the hospital for several days after
the procedure and may have a small
tube called a nephrostomy tube inserted
through the skin into the kidney. The
nephrostomy tube drains urine and
any residual stone fragments from the
kidney into a urine collection bag. The
tube usually is left in the kidney for
2 or 3 days while the child remains in
How are kidney stones in children prevented?
To prevent kidney stones, health care providers and their patients must understand what is causing the stones to form. Especially in children with suspected metabolic abnormalities or with recurrent stones, a 24-hour urine collection is obtained to measure daily urine volume and to determine if any underlying mineral abnormality is making a child more likely to form stones. Based on the analysis of the collected urine, the treatment can be individualized to address a metabolic problem.
In all circumstances, children should drink plenty of fluids to keep the urine diluted and flush away substances that could form kidney stones. Urine should be almost clear.
Eating, Diet, and Nutrition
Families may benefit from meeting with a
dietitian to learn how dietary management
can help in preventing stones. Depending on
the underlying cause of the stone formation,
medications may be necessary to prevent
recurrent stones. Dietary changes and medications
may be required for a long term or,
quite often, for life. Some common changes
include the following:
- Children who tend to make calcium oxalate stones or have hypercalciuria should eat a regular amount of dietary calcium and limit salt intake. A thiazide diuretic medication may be given to some children to reduce the amount of calcium leaking into the urine.
- Children who have large amounts of oxalate in the urine may need to limit foods high in oxalate, such as chocolate, peanut butter, and dark-colored soft drinks.
- Children who form uric acid or cystine stones may need extra potassium citrate or potassium carbonate in the form of a pill or liquid medication. Avoiding foods high in purines—such as meat, fish, and shellfish—may also help prevent uric acid stones.
Points to Remember
- A kidney stone is a solid piece of material that forms in a kidney when some substances that are normally found in the urine become highly concentrated.
- Kidney stones occur in infants, children, and teenagers from all races and ethnicities.
- Kidney stones in children are diagnosed using a combination of urine, blood, and imaging tests.
- The treatment for a kidney stone usually depends on its size and composition as well as whether it is causing symptoms of pain or obstructing the urinary tract.
- Small stones usually pass through the urinary tract without treatment. Still, children will often require pain control and encouragement to drink lots of fluids to help move the stone along.
- Children with larger stones, or stones that block urine flow and cause great pain, may need to be hospitalized for more urgent treatment.
- Hospital treatments may include shock wave lithotripsy (SWL), removal of the stone with a ureteroscope, lithotripsy with a ureteroscope, or percutaneous nephrolithotomy.
- To prevent recurrent kidney stones, health care providers and their patients must understand what is causing the stones to form.
- In all circumstances, children should drink plenty of fluids to keep the urine diluted and flush away substances that could form kidney stones. Urine should be almost clear.
Hope through Research
The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), one of the National Institutes of Health, supports research aimed at better understanding and preventing kidney stones in children. Researchers supported by the NIDDK have identified three proteins that inhibit the formation of calcium oxalate stones. Conventional urine tests do not provide information about the presence or absence of these proteins. Developing a test for these proteins that can be used in the clinical setting will help health care providers identify children at risk for stone formation so they can manage that risk.
Participants in clinical trials can play a more active role in their own health care, gain access to new research treatments before they are widely available, and help others by contributing to medical research. For information about current studies, visit www.ClinicalTrials.gov.

NEED A FAST ANSWER TO ANY QUESTION OR ASSIGNMENT?

You will get a detailed answer to your question or assignment in the shortest time possible.

## Here's the Solution to this Question

a) Let $X = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\}$ and $R = \{(x,y)|x-y\text{ is divisible by }3\}$ in $X$. Let us show that $R$ is an equivalence relation. Since $x-x=0$ is divisible by 3 for any $x\in X$, we conclude that $(x,x)\in R$ for any $x\in X$, and hence $R$ is a reflexive relation. If $x,y\in X$ and $(x,y)\in R,$ then $x-y$ is divisible by 3. It follows that $y-x=-(x-y)$ is also divisible by 3, and hence $(y,x)\in R.$

We conclude that the relation $R$ is symmetric. If $x,y,z\in X$ and $(x,y)\in R,\ (y,z)\in R,$ then $x-y$ is divisible by 3 and $y-z$ is divisible by 3. It follows that $x-z=(x-y)+(y-z)$ is also divisible by 3, and hence $(x,z)\in R.$ We conclude that the relation $R$ is transitive. Consequently, $R$ is an equivalence relation.

b) Let $A = \{1,2,3,4\}$ and let $R = \{(1,1), (1,2),(2,1),(2,2),(3,4),(4,3), (3,3), (4,4)\}$ be an equivalence relation on $R$. Let us determine $A/R$. Taking into account that $[a]=\{x\in A\ |\ (x,a)\in R\}$ and hence $[1]=\{1,2\}=[2],\ [3]=\{3,4\}=[4],$ we conclude that $A/R=\{[a]\ |\ a\in A\}=\{[1],[3]\}.$

c) Let us draw the Hasse diagram of lattices, $(L_1,<)$ and $(L_2,<)$ where $L_1 = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\}$ and $L_2 = \{2, 3, 6, 12, 24\}$ and a < b if and only if a divides b.

Note that a Hasse diagram is a graphical rendering of a partially ordered set displayed via the cover relation of the partially ordered set with an implied upward orientation. A point is drawn for each element of the poset, and line segments are drawn between these points according to the following two rules:

1. If $x  in the poset, then the point corresponding to $x$ appears lower in the drawing than the point corresponding to $y$.

2. The line segment between the points corresponding to any two elements  $x$ and  $y$ of the poset is included in the drawing iff  $x$ covers $y$  or  $y$  covers $x$.

In our case, $x if and only if $x|y.$ Therefore, the Hasse diagrams are the following:

What is Rainwater Harvesting?
Rainwater harvesting is an ancient practice of catching and holding rain for later use. In a rainwater harvesting system, rain is gathered from a building rooftop or other source and is held in large containers for future use, such as watering gardens or washing cars. This practice reduces the demand on water resources and is excellent during times of drought.
Why is it Important?
In addition to reducing the demand on our water sources (especially important during drought), rainwater harvesting also helps prevent water pollution. Surprised?
Here’s why: the success of the 1972 Clean Water Act has meant that the greatest threat to New York’s waterbodies comes not from industrial sources, but rather through the small actions we all make in our daily lives. For example, in a rain storm, the oil, pesticides, animal waste, and litter from our lawns, sidewalks, driveways, and streets are washed down into our sewers. This is called non-point source (NPS) pollution because the pollutants come from too many sources to be identified. Rainwater harvesting diverts water from becoming polluted stormwater; instead, this captured rainwater may be used to irrigate gardens near where it falls.
In New York City, keeping rainwater out of the sewer system is very important. That’s because the city has an old combined sewer system that uses the same pipes to transport both household waste and stormwater to sewage treatment plants. During heavy rains, the system overloads; then untreated sewage and contaminated stormwater overflow into our rivers and estuary, with serious consequences:
Who is Harvesting Rainwater in New York City?
Back in 2002, a drought emergency pushed many community gardens to the brink of extinction. For the first time in twenty years, community gardeners were denied permission to use fire hydrants, the primary source of water for most community gardens. This crisis led to the formation of the Water Resources Group (WRG), an open collaboration of community gardening and environmental organizations. With help from the WRG, rainwater harvesting systems have now been built as demonstration sites in twenty NYC community gardens.
At community gardens that harvest rainwater, rain is diverted from the gutters of adjacent buildings and is stored in tanks in the gardens. A 1-inch rainfall on a 1,000-square-foot roof produces 600 gallons of water. The tanks are mosquito proof, so the standing water does not encourage West Nile virus. Because rainwater is chlorine free, it is better than tap water for plant growth, meaning healthier plants. And it’s free!
What are Other Cities Doing?
Many cities have adopted creative, low-cost ways to stop wasting rainwater by diverting it from their sewage systems and putting it to use where it falls. Here are some examples:
What Can I Do?
Spread the word! Educate those around you on the importance of lifestyle decisions.
Tell people not to litter, dump oil down storm drains, or overfertilize their lawns.
Install a rainwater harvesting system at your home, school, business, or local community center.
Contact your local elected officials, and let them know you support rainwater harvesting!

Here to There: A History of Mapping
From the 16th to 18th centuries, many European mapmakers were convinced that California was an island — an Edenic paradise populated by black Amazons. The error persisted for over a hundred years after expeditions had proven that California was, in fact, firmly attached to the mainland. The idea of California as a fierce paradise appealed to Europeans, who were reluctant to let the mundane reality interfere with their vision of the world.
So in that spirit, we’re devoting this episode of BackStory to maps — asking what they show us about who we are and and where we want to go. How do maps shape the way we see our communities and our world? What do they tell us about the kind of information we value? And what do they distort, or ignore?
Please help us shape this show! Share your questions, ideas and stories below. Have opinions on New York vs. D.C. subway maps? On the merits or shortcomings of Google Maps? And do you even still use old-fashioned, ink-and-paper maps? Leave us a comment!

Our last blog post in which we discussed our favourite animated films prompted us to think back to animations we have enjoyed from childhood. Some of the best loved animations of all time date back to the 1920s where Walt Disney and Warner Brothers revolutionised the industry. The earliest version of Mickey Mouse was created in 1928 followed closely by the Warner Brothers Cartoons in 1930. But what about even earlier than that? Where did animation begin, when and how?
So, we asked Kurobot to share his knowledge and teach us all about the origin of animation.
Motion in art can date back as far as Paleolithic cave paintings, a very very long time ago! Paintings of animals with many legs in various positions is noted as the first attempt at conveying motion. Other pieces include sequences and phases of movement in both animals and people painted onto bowls, plates and murals.
Animation before film dates back to the 1600s where numerous devices were used to display animated images. The magic lantern, invented 1650, used a translucent oil painting and a lamp to project images onto adjacent flat surfaces. It was often used to display monsters and demons to convince people they were witnessing supernatural events. (We have ours ready for Halloween)
The Thaumatrope, invented 1824, was one of the first devices to demonstrate the Phi phenomenon, the human (and Kurobot) brains ability to persistently perceive an image. The device used a small circular piece of card with different images on each side, strung onto a central cord. When the cord is spun between the fingers the images appear to merge into one creating a moving image.
Possibly the most well known origin of motion picture is the humble flip book. Invented 1868, a flip book features a sequence of animated images on the unbound edge of each page of the book. When bending the pages back and flicking through the book the images merge due to the rapid replacement of each image with the next, forming a short animation.
The silent era of animation began in the late 1800s with the production of short stop motion animations, the most famous of which, produced in 1920 was Felix the cat. Felix was the first merchandised cartoon character and became a household name.
1923 marked the beginning of the golden age of animation when a small studio “Laugh-o-grams” went bankrupt, and its owner, Walt Disney opened a new studio in Los Angeles. This was possibly one of the most significant events in the history of animation.
The first Disney productions include “The Alice Comedies” series, “Song Car Tunes” and “Dinner Time”, however the most notable breakthrough entitled “Steamboat Willie” featured an anthropomorphic mouse named “Mickey” neglecting his work on a steamboat to instead make music with the animals aboard the boat. This would mark the development of animation in our generation including TV, and CGI animation.

Which is it - CURA or Cura?
I see a number of people writing "CURA", when I have always called it "Cura". So I started to wonder if CURA was a capitalised acronym, like LiDAR or NATO (but not like radar or laser).
I had a look and the Wikipedia entry, Cura (software) doesn't appear to suggest that.
So I wondered if it was a marketing thing.

After all, over on SE.Arduino, lots of people write "Arduino UNO" - I myself did so to, for a long time, until Nick Gammon picked me up on it:



I think that the reason that I did was that the Arduino pages write it in that way (arguably incorrectly) and it just seems to be a branding/marketing ploy.
So, is this the same sort of thing with CURA? I am just wondering where it started and came from?1

1 As one does on a boring rainy Sunday morning :-)

I don't think this is an acronym, but be aware that acronyms are spelled differently in Britain and in USA.  For example, "Nato" and "NATO", or 'Aids" and "AIDS".

As of version 4 the splash screen has changed, also the branding/naming of the product throughout Ultimaker's website.

Technically it is not CURA or cura, it is Ultimaker Cura.

Huh, I wish they'd make their minds up, about what its name is, and not keep changing it! :-)

They rebranded the software and names, there is a posting on their own forums somewhere, but I couldn't find it. This is the name they stick with! For now that is ;-) I think that now Ultimaker has established itself very well in the 3D printer market that it is not going to change.

Actually, it's neither:

If you wanna believe this image, it's: Ultimaker cura ... all lower case.

One satellite, two planets and movement

1. Aug 5, 2013

Rapidrain

I am trying to write a program to show the flight of a satellite in the neighbourhood of two large planets. In all of this the mass of the satellite is negligible.

I have the potential energy from planet1 = pe1 and
the potential energy from planet2 = pe2 and
the kinetic energy of the satellite = ke

Using the sum of the two planets' acc vectors to create a !! single !! acc vector I can calculate the next position using the current position, the velocity vector and the movement caused by the !! single !! acc vector.

This is good; (it works fine in a single planet and satellite model).

The new velocity vector can also be similarly deduced adding the induced velocity from the acc vector to the original velocity vector.

This is also good; (it also works fine in a single planet and satellite model).

However Total Energy is just a bit off. Using my model with a short sliver of time I have a decrease of total energy by a factor 6.5 * 10**-4. Not a really big number but I want to find how I can reduce it to 0.0.

I have three possibilities of tweaking the model to reach change in TE = 0.0 :

1. only increase the velocity and thereby the kinetic energy

2. only increase the distance from the two planets and thereby the potential energy

3. increase both vel and dist (in a certain proportion) to increase both KE and PE

Does physics, nature, mathematics or logic define which of these three paths to explore?

This is known as Euler's three body problem. I suggest you loop that up and think whether you really need to do what you are doing.

3. Aug 5, 2013

Sorry voko, but I don't understand what you mean by "loop that up".

And really need to do what I am doing? Please explain.

Also known as "the problem of two fixed centers".

That, however, is not the cause Rapidrain's problem. The issue is how position and velocity are being updated. What follows is a very brief tutorial in numerical techniques to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE).

First off, Rapidrain, you are trying to solve what's called a second order initial value problem. Second order means you have first (velocity) and second (acceleration) derivatives, initial value means you know the position and velocity at the start time and want to find them at some end time.

First order ODE techniques

A large number of techniques for solving first order initial value problems exist. You can take advantage of these by converting this second order ODE to a first order ODE. Any second order ODE can be re-expressed as a first order ODE by creating a doubled-up state vector that comprises the zeroth and first derivatives. For example, $\dot x(t) = v(t), \ddot x(t) = a(t)$ becomes $u(t) = (x(t), v(t)), \dot u(t) = (v(t), a(t))$.

The simplest first order ODE solver is Euler's method: $u(t+\Delta t) = u(t) + \Delta t\, \dot u(t)$. You should never use Euler's method. However, it is important to understand how it works because almost every other integration technique can be viewed as making smarter Euler-type steps.

For a second order ODE, Euler's method becomes
\begin{aligned} \vec x(t+\Delta t) &= \vec x(t) + \Delta t \, \vec v(t) \\ \vec v(t+\Delta t) &= \vec v(t) + \Delta t \, \vec a(t) \end{aligned}

There are a slew of first order ODE solvers that are far better than Euler's method. Runge-Kutta integrators take a number of intermediate steps between t and t+Δt before arriving at an estimate for u(t+Δt). Predictor/corrector methods keep a history of old values so that it can predict u(t+Δt) using one algorithm and the correct it using another. Google Runge-Kutta, multistep method, and predictor-corrector for more info.

Second order ODE techniques

An alternate approach is to take advantage of the fact that this is a second order problem that you are trying to solve. The equivalent of Euler's method for a second order ODE is to take steps via
\begin{aligned} \vec v(t+\Delta t) &= \vec v(t) + \Delta t \, \vec a(t) \\ \vec x(t+\Delta t) &= \vec x(t) + \Delta t \, \vec v(t+\Delta t) \end{aligned}
This is called the Euler-Cromer method, the symplectic Euler method, plus a whole bunch of other names. The only difference between this approach and the basic Euler method is the order in which position and velocity are updated. Simply switching to updating velocity first makes a *huge* difference. The basic Euler method doesn't even come close to conserving energy. This approach does.

However, Euler-Cromer is still lousy. A simple mod to this approach is to offset the calculation of position and velocity by half a time step. This is what leapfrog, position verlet, and velocity verlet integration do. Google these names for more info. Even more advanced are the Gauss-Jackson techniques.

I'd suggest trying a variant of position verlet. You'll have to bootstrap this by computing the acceleration vector at t=0.
\begin{aligned} \vec x(t+\Delta t/2) &= \vec x(t) + \frac 1 2 \Delta t \, \vec v(t) \\ \vec v(t+\Delta t/2) &= \vec v(t) + \frac 1 2 \Delta t \, \vec a \\ & \text{compute and save midpoint acceleration}\,\vec a = f(\vec x(t+\Delta t/2)) \\ \vec v(t+\Delta t) &= \vec v(t+\Delta t/2) + \frac 1 2 \Delta t \, \vec a \\ \vec x(t+\Delta t) &= \vec x(t+\Delta t/2) + \frac 1 2 \Delta t \, \vec v(t+\Delta t) \end{aligned}
This is no more expensive computationally than Euler-Cromer (the expense is typically in the derivative computations) but it is far more accurate.

8. Aug 5, 2013

voko

As you most certainly know, solving ODEs might be wholly unnecessary in this problem. Which would eliminate the problem entirely. That is the whole point behind my urging Rapidrain to study the classical approach.

9. Aug 5, 2013

Rapidrain

Very good DH. This helps much more than "go look it up".

Question though : your equations show : x(t + del*t) = x(t) + del*t*v(t)

shouldn't the right side also have the distance covered by acceleration :

x(t) + del*t*v(t) + (1/2)*acc(t)*(del*t)**2 ??

I'll give your algorithm a try.

## Introduction

Multi-channel signal generation and detection are indispensable in many applications such as multi-qubit quantum computing and multi-sensor systems. Synchronization of signal channels comes to the equation when the temporal sequence of events is of interest, especially for fast physical phenomena with short lifetimes. Zurich Instruments offers the Multi-Device Synchronization (MDS) feature embedded in all its products to provide full synchronization in a scalable approach [1].

In this post, we learn how to setup a multi-channel lock-in measurement by synchronizing multiple MFLI Lock-in Amplifiers using the MDS toolbox provided with Zurich Instruments products [2]. MDS  is a powerful tool to align the timestamp of several instruments enabling multi-channel signal generation and acquisition. In order to have a stable and synchronized timestamp among multiple instruments, it is essential to have the following two conditions satisfied:

• A common reference clock to provide identical clock speed for all the instruments.
• A common trigger signal to synchronize the starting point of device clocks.

The first criterion guarantees that all the instruments measure a time interval equally, while the second condition forces the devices to start from an identical timestamp. A device timestamp is a counter which starts counting with the device sampling rate when it is switched on. To keep the timestamp identical among all instruments, it is necessary to have an identical sampling rate for all the devices; therefore, MDS only works for instruments of the same kind unless their counting rate is adjusted to be equal.

## Cabling

MDS requires two levels of synchronization, i.e. reference clock and timestamp. Reference clock synchronization is achieved by connecting the 10-MHz clock output of each instrument to the 10-MHz clock input of another device in a series fashion starting from the master instrument and ending with the last slave device. For timestamp synchronization, trigger output of the master device must be distributed to all the instruments in a parallel (star) mode. All the cables should be coaxial with BNC connectors and it is necessary to have equal-length cables for trigger signals. If you have $$n$$ instruments one as master and the others as slaves, how many pieces of cable are required to fully attach all the devices and make them MDS-ready?

• According to the series configuration of reference clocks, $$n-1$$ cables are necessary to have all the reference clocks connected.
• According to the star configuration of trigger signals, at least $$n+1$$ cables are needed to distribute the master trigger to all the slaves.

It should be noted that for trigger distribution, one needs to have a ($$1\times n$$)-signal splitter and it can be easily made by some T-connectors if a commercial splitter is not available. In this blog, we use 4 MFLI lock-in amplifiers and thus we need 3 cables for reference clocks and 5 cables for trigger signals. Using 3 T-connectors we can make a 1-to-4 signal splitter as shown in the following figure.

Fig. 1. Cabling for the trigger signals connection of master and slave devices in a setup of 4 MFLI instruments. The trigger output of master is distributed to the trigger input of master and slaves with equal-length cables. The 1-to-4 splitter is simply made by attaching 3 T-connectors together.

Using the above cable set for the trigger signals and also a series cabling set for clock signals, we can connect 4 MFLI instruments to prepare them for synchronization by MDS. The following figure shows the rear panel of all the 4 instruments stacked on top of each other. The cables connect trigger and clock signals according to the star and series configurations, respectively. Also the power cables and USB/Ethernet cables are shown in the figure. Please note that both USB and Ethernet can be used to connect the instruments to the host PC and it is not required to have the same connection type for all the devices.

Fig. 2. Rear panel of 4 MFLI instruments (left) connected according to the MDS requirements shown in the scheme (right). The BNC cables show the trigger ports connected in a star configuration and the clock ports connected in a series fashion. The instrument on top is master and the rest are slaves.

For MFLI/MFIA instruments, all the MDS cabling is in the rear panel; therefore, all the ports in the front panel are freely available for signal and reference generation and detection.

## Connectivity

All the Zurich Instruments products are controlled via the LabOne software which provides a web-based user interface (UI) as well as application program interfaces (API) for MATLAB, Python, LabVIEW, .NET and C. The MFLI/MFIA device can run the LabOne software on its embedded processor which means there is no need to install the software on the host computer, but by running the LabOne software on the device, synchronization of multiple instruments is NOT possible. This is because the controlling software of each device is independent from the others and they do not communicate with each other. Therefore, it is essential to install the LabOne software on the host PC. The latest version of LabOne software is available here in our download center.

After installing and running LabOne, if you have all the instruments connected to your computer directly or via network, you should be able to see them all in the landing page of LabOne as shown in the figure below. In this case, there are 4 MFLI devices connected to the host computer.

Fig. 3. Landing page of LabOne in the Basic view showing 4 MFLI instruments with their serial number DEVXXXX connected to the host computer.

The LabOne software includes a data server to communicate with the instruments. Moreover, there is a data server living in each MFLI device. In order to be able to synchronize multiple devices, it is necessary to have one data server communicating with all the instruments and thus, it must be the data server running on the host computer. By default, the LabOne software connects to the data server living in the device; therefore, it is required to change the settings before connecting to the instruments. Fig. 4 shows the landing page of LabOne in the “Advanced” mode. From this page, we can change the data server to the local one which has a local host IP of 127.0.0.1 with port 8004.

Fig. 4. Landing page of LabOne in the Advanced view showing the relevant settings to connect to the local host’s data server.

After connecting to the local data server by clicking on the “Connect” button in Fig. 4, the enable button “En” for all the devices will be activated so that by clicking on each button, the corresponding device is connected to the host as highlighted by red boxes in the following figure.

Fig. 5. After connecting to the local data server, the En button is ready to connect to the corresponding instrument.

Having connected to all the instruments as shown in the above figure, one can open a single session of LabOne by double-clicking on one of the devices. All the device-related tabs in the user interface such as Lock-in, Aux, Device, etc. must have a small blue pop-up menu on top which includes all the devices connected to the local data server. This is highlighted in Fig. 6 by a red box showing all the 4 instruments in the pop-up menu of the lock-in tab.

Fig. 6. Single session of LabOne UI showing 4 devices in a pop-up menu next to the title of device-related tabs. Click on the image to enlarge.

It should be noted that if there is no pop-up menu indicating more than one instrument, then there is something missing with the proper connection to the devices.

## Multi-Device Synchronization

Once all the instruments are properly connected to the local data server on the host computer and the LabOne user interface shows them, we can open the MDS tab which lists all the connected devices as shown in the left side of Fig. 7. The devices must selected in a proper order to have first the master and then the slaves according to the sequence of their clock connection. In order to distinguish the instruments, the “Locate” button can be pressed to make the power LED of the corresponding device blink. After selecting the device in a proper order, we press the “Start/Stop Sync” button to start the synchronization process as shown below.

Fig. 7. MDS tab of LabOne UI showing all the connected instruments and the status of synchronization. Click on the image to enlarge.

When the process is finished, a green flag in the status section indicates a successful synchronization as depicted in the above figure. In case the process is unsuccessful, the flag will be red and thus we need to recheck the cables, clock and trigger signals.

When the instruments are synchronized, all the slave devices receive an external clock from another instrument; only the master device uses its own internal 10 MHz clock. Therefore, all the slaves should be able to lock to an external clock source. To check that, you can go to the Device tab of LabOne and change the clock source from “Internal” to “Clk 10 MHz” as depicted in the following figure. If a proper external clock is connected to the clock input of the device, the status remains at ‘Clk 10 MHz’; otherwise, it jumps back to the ‘Internal’ mode and thus you need to check the provided clock signal.

Fig. 8. Clock settings in the Device tab of LabOne for slave devices indicating an external source for 10 MHz clock.

In addition to the 10 MHz clock, a proper trigger signaling is required for synchronization. To check the trigger signals, you should open the DIO tab in LabOne and see a proper trigger acquisition at “Trigger In 1” similar to the figure below. The two moving green flags show the low and high levels of the trigger signal coming from “Trigger Out 1” of the master instrument. In case, “Trigger In 1” does not show blinking flags, you need to check your cabling and/or modify the threshold level of trigger detection in the DIO tab.

Fig. 9. DIO tab of master device showing the trigger signals at Trigger Out 1 and Trigger In 1.

It should be noted that only the master device generates the “MDS Sync Out” at its trigger output as shown in Fig. 9, while all the instruments receive trigger signals at their trigger input similar to the above figure.

## Multi-Channel Measurements

After synchronizing all the instruments using the MDS tool, they can be treated like a single device with multiple input/output channels. A single session of LabOne user interface can control all the instruments and acquire and process data from the synchronized devices simultaneously. This is possible thanks to the clock and timestamp synchronizations which provide the same understanding of time for all the instruments. Using the 4 synchronized MFLI devices in this blog, we can simply perform a 4-channel measurement on a 4-port network. The master MFLI drives one port of the network connected to its Signal Output via a directional coupler [3] to be able to measure the reflection from the driven port. The reflection from the driven port is measured by Signal Input of the master device. All the other 3 ports of the network are connected to the Signal Input of the slave instruments. Fig. 10 shows the temporal measurement of all the 4 ports of the network using 4 synchronized instruments. Any change in the response of the network can be monitored synchronously at all its ports as shown in the following figure.

Fig. 10. Plotter tool of LabOne UI showing 4 signals from 4 different devices each measuring one port of a 4-port electrical network. Click on the image to enlarge.

In order to add signals from various devices to the vertical axis group of tools such as plotter, we use the button highlighted in the above figure to open the signal selection window which includes signals from all the instruments.

Besides time-domain measurements, it is possible to carry out multi-channel measurements in the frequency domain. To do so, not only the frequency of the master’s numerical oscillator sweeps to excite and measure one port of the network, but also the numerical oscillators on all the slave devices sweep in parallel with the master’s to measure all other ports of the network. Fig. 11 demonstrates how the sweeper module of LabOne can acquire the spectral response of all the 4 ports of the network measured by 4 instruments simultaneously.

Fig. 11. Sweeper module of LabOne UI depicting 4 simultaneous measurements of the 4-port network by sweeping the frequency of 4 synchronized MFLI devices. Click on the image to enlarge.

It is worth noting that by sweeping the frequency of numerical oscillators in different instruments, we change the initial phase of each oscillator to a random number. Therefore, this method is only suitable to measure the amplitude response and not the phase response versus frequency. For a proper phase measurement, we need to synchronize all the numerical oscillators in different devices for each frequency point. This can be done by external reference or the ‘Osc Phase Sync’ button in the MDS tab shown in Fig. 7.

## Conclusion

Multiple instruments can be synchronized by the MDS toolbox to convert them to one multi-channel device capable of generating and measuring several signal ports simultaneously. MDS synchronizes the instruments at two levels: clock and timestamp. This helps the user to carry out time- and frequency-domain measurements using multiple instruments while a single user interface or API session controls the entire instrument assembly. As a result, one can save a lot of time while characterizing multi-port electrical networks by simultaneous measurement of multi-channel signals.

# Supersymmetric Path Integrals I: Differential Forms on the Loop Space

#### Autoren: Florian Hanisch, Matthias Ludewig (2017)

In this paper, we construct an integral map for differential forms on the loop space of Riemannian spin manifolds. In particular, the even and odd Bismut-Chern characters are integrable by this map, with their integrals given by indices of Dirac operators. We also show that our integral map satisfies a version of the localization principle in equivariant cohomology. This should provide a rigorous background for supersymmetry proofs of the Atiyah-Singer Index theorem.

HE3D Prusa Z-Axis Motor Error
I have an HE3D Prusa XI3 that I have assembled but the z axis motors aren't functioning properly, they will whine instead of turn. They will turn if I use Z babystepping or position changes but will not when doing a fast position changes or in normal use

You are probably driving the motors with insufficient current. Try increasing the motor current, by adjusting the potentiometer on the respective stepper driver. Turn it clockwise until your motors stop skipping steps.

I've been playing with that... The Z-axis motors are running in parallel in this model, I think the A4988 isn't strong enough to torque two Nema 17's in parallel, but all this is rather foreign to me.

I realize that the motors are wired in series, not parallel. Sorry for the confusion.

# Bateman transform

In the mathematical study of partial differential equations, the Bateman transform is a method for solving the Laplace equation in four dimensions and wave equation in three by using a line integral of a holomorphic function in three complex variables. It is named after the English mathematician Harry Bateman, who first published the result in (Bateman 1904).

The formula asserts that if ƒ is a holomorphic function of three complex variables, then

$\phi(w,x,y,z) = \oint_\gamma f\left((w+ix)+(iy+z)\zeta,(iy-z)+(w-ix)\zeta,\zeta\right)\,d\zeta$

is a solution of the Laplace equation, which follows by differentiation under the integral. Furthermore, Bateman asserted that the most general solution of the Laplace equation arises in this way.

Science -- Asher et al. 307 (5712): 1091:
We describe several fossils referable to Gomphos elkema from deposits close to the Paleocene-Eocene boundary at Tsagan Khushu, Mongolia. Gomphos shares a suite of cranioskeletal characters with extant rabbits, hares, and pikas but retains a primitive dentition and jaw compared to its modern relatives. Phylogenetic analysis supports the position of Gomphos as a stem lagomorph and excludes Cretaceous taxa from the crown radiation of placental mammals. Our results support the hypothesis that rodents and lagomorphs radiated during the Cenozoic and diverged from other placental mammals close to the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary.
Lagomorphs are rabbits, hares, and pikas. This might be referred to as a "missing link" of the rodents. Why do we care? Most mammals are rodents, and this tells us about the evolution of the most successful group of mammals. Cool!

Why is our moderation queue order different from the other sites I have access to?
Below are the review queues for ELU, ELL, and 3DP:
  
Is there some reason that the order here is not the same across sites?

honestly? No idea... Bug?

Davo, it might be a good idea to mark Glorfindel's answer as the accepted one... :-)

Oops, thank you.

The order is different because this is a beta site. They're shown in the order of reputation required to access them (and then alphabetical).
So First Posts and Late Answers are always at the bottom (requiring 500 reputation on graduated sites and 350 on beta sites like 3D Printing). On beta sites, Close Votes and Reopen Votes are next (at 500 reputation), followed by Low Quality Posts and Suggested Edits (1000 reputation) at the top. On graduated sites, it's the other way around: Low Quality Posts and Suggested Edits at 2000 reputation, and Close Votes and Reopen Votes at 3000 reputation.
Or, as Shog9 put it:

They're ordered first by the minimum reputation needed to access the queue, and then alphabetically by the name of the queue.
The purpose of this ordering is to keep the list as consistent as possible until your privilege-level changes - the hope is that folks use this as their primary means of accessing the queues, and as such we're not forcing reviewers to override their muscle-memory every time they go to access a specific queue - a worthy design goal for a menu that appears on just about every page of the site.

Substitution Algebra Revision | KS3 Maths Resources

## What you need to know

Things to remember:

• Substitution just means replacing a letter with a number.
• We don’t write $\times$ when there is a number before a letter, so you need to remember that it is hiding there!
• A fraction is another way of writing a division question.

So, what is substitution? Well, it just means to “replace” one thing with another. So, in maths, this usually means replacing a letter with a number.

Use substitution to find the value of $x+7$ when x = 12

Here we are told that $x=12$, so all we have to do is replace the $x$ in the expression with 12!

$$x+7=12+7=19$$

Easy peasy! We do the same with our other operations too!

Use substitution to find the value of $x-4$ when x = 15

$$x-4=15-4=11$$

Multiplication questions are a little different, because we need to remember that there is a hidden $\times$ symbol between the number and letter.

Use substitution to find the value of $5x$ when x = 13

$$5x=5\times x=5\times13=65$$

Divisions questions could either appear as a division:

Use substitution to find the value of $x\div3$ when x=9

$$x\div3=9\div3=3$$

Or as a fraction that we have to change:

Use substitution to find the value of $\frac{20}{x}$ when x=5

$$\frac{20}{x}=20\div x=20\div5=4$$

Found throughout tropical regions of Africa, the Emperor Scorpion is one of the largest in the scorpion family. A predatory carnivore their diet ranges from insects to small mammals. In captivity we feed them live crickets, meal worms or morio worms about once a week.
- Live up to 8 years.
- With an exoskeleton which they molt once a year to enable growth.
- Adult scorpions can grow to 15 centimetres in across.
- Habitat being rain forest floor.
- Nocturnal arachnids.
Although it may look very dangerous, generally speaking the larger scorpions tend to be less poisonous than the smaller ones. Although it would still be painful if we were to get stung, it would not be life threatening.

At NIDA's last Drug Facts Chat Day, Razorfang asked this question:
"can you get viruses from drugs?"
The answer to this might surprise you. Although you can't get viruses directly from drugs, using drugs can increase your chances of catching a virus like HIV (the virus that causes AIDS). In fact, behaviors associated with drug abuse are one of the biggest factors in the spread of HIV across the US.
That's because drugs can mess up your judgment and lead to bad decisions—bad decisions like unsafe sex. And risky sex can lead to more than pregnancy. It can also lead to becoming infected with HIV or other sexually transmitted viruses.

What you will learn
In this Maya tutorial we'll learn how to begin Maya's powerful Ocean features. Using Maya Oceans, we'll be able to achieve quality results within a matter of minutes. We'll begin this project by learning the basics of creating a Maya Ocean and what it is actually made of. We'll then learn about attributes we need to set early in the project. Then we'll learn how to control the noisiness of waves and their length. After that, we'll create line graphs to change each wave's height, turbulence and peak. We'll finish the tutorial by adding foam and editing the color information of the shader.

Most of us know someone with a food allergy. I certainly do-two of my children have been labeled with life threatening food allergies; one to peanuts and tree nuts and the other to soy. Every time I head to the grocery store I spend a tremendous amount of time reading each and every label-including labels that I am familiar with to be sure they haven’t changed. This is a necessity to keep my family safe and healthy.
In January, 2006, the new Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA) took effect. The law requires food manufacturers to identify all ingredients in a food product containing one or more of the eight major allergens.
The eight foods identified by the law are:
- Fish (e.g., bass, flounder, cod)
- Crustacean shellfish (e.g. crab, lobster, shrimp)
- Tree nuts (e.g., almonds, walnuts, pecans)
The law states that the name of the food source of a major food allergen must appear:
- In parentheses following the name of the ingredient.
Examples: “lecithin (soy),” “flour (wheat),” and “whey (milk)”
– OR –
- Immediately after or next to the list of ingredients in a “contains” statement.
Example: “Contains Wheat, Milk, and Soy.”
Most companies are very clear in their labeling and use the “contains” language in bold after their ingredient list.
HERE’S WHERE IT GETS REALLY CONFUSING
I have been scrutinizing food labels for years-I am noticing that I have to squint these days to read the fine print. Many labels contain language about cross-contamination-if the food was processed on shared equipment or shared processing lines with one of the 8 allergens.
But not all manufacturers are listing cross-contamination information. The reason being- companies are not required to include this information. There are no particular regulations on whether they need to add statements such as “may contain traces of peanuts,” for example, for foods that aren’t supposed to contain such allergens. It is a company’s choice whether or not to include this information, and how to word it.
How to decide if cross-contamination is an issue
So the bottom line is YOU will need to determine what degree of risk you are comfortable with when purchasing foods. That is a lot of pressure when you are buying food for someone else.
Here is my internal checklist for deciding whether or not to buy a product:
- I first check the ingredients list for the 8 common allergens.
- If there is no cross-contamination or “may contain” information I then look at the other same brand products on the shelf. If there are other products that have either nuts or soy I will more often than not assume there might be cross-contamination.
- I might contact the manufacturer on occasion to ask specifically about a cross-contamination issue.
Let me know how do you decide which products are safe to purchase?

“Bacon’s major contribution to the development of science lies in his natural philosophy, his philosophy of scientific method, and in his projects for the practical organization of science. During the last years of his life, he expounded these ideas in a series of works, of which the Twoo bookes was the first. The only work Bacon ever published in English, it was later expanded and latinized into De augmentis scientiarum (1623). In the Twoo bookes, Bacon concerned himself primarily with the classification of philosophy and the sciences and with developing his influential view of the relation between science and theology. While preserving the traditional distinction between knowledge obtained by divine revelation and knowledge acquired through the senses, Bacon saw both theoretical and applied science as religious duties, the first for a greater knowledge of God through his creation, and the second for the practice of charity to one’s fellows by improving their condition. This view of science as a religious function maintained its authority throughout the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, and was an important factor in the public success of the scientific movement” (Norman Library).

Sorry for the late reply. First, thanks for responding to this - didn't think anyone would. Second, could you provide an example of how to apply the E-L equation to take these functions down to an ODE?

[–] 1 point2 points  (0 children)

Here is a functional

S = \int 1/2 m x'2 - 1/2 k x2 dt

The E-L equation says take d/dt dL/dx' - dL/dx = 0

Here:

dL/dx' = m x'

d/dt dL/dx' = m x''

dL/dx = -k x

So the ODE you need to solve is

mx'' - - kx = 0 mx'' + kx = 0

You should be able to solve that ODE.

So, I was told to use the Hamiltonian method for #1, 2.

Quite frankly, I don't think I've felt this lost in a math course before. This is a summer class, so the progress is accelerated, but no one in our class is able to follow the professor. He's jumping around the chapters in our required text (this hw problem dealt with topics not really covered in the book). Any advice on what I should do in order to actually learn some Diff Eq?

I am an undergrad. This course is listed as a 300 level course, so I'm not sure if it's necessarily an introduction course to Diff. Eqn's. But I'm taking it as an equivalent course, so I can transfer credits to the university I'm a full-time student at. The equivalent course to my university is titled "Introduction to Diff Eqn's" and it's a 200 level course. So I'm not sure why they're listed as equivalents.

The book we're using is, "Introductory Differential Equations using Sage" by David Joyner and Marshall Hampton.

Use of change filament tag
I have just written a usage guidance for change-filament. 
I assume that the tag is for, and only for, methods to change filament during a print. Not for questions which ask whether someone should change from using one type of filament to another type, between completed prints..?
If that assumption is correct, then there are two questions that are incorrectly tagged:

Why won't my filament feed through the extruder anymore?

Brain Matures a Few Years Late in ADHD
but Follows Normal Pattern
A 2007 press release from the National Institute of Mental Health discusses brain development in ADHD youths. In some cases, brain development is delayed as much as three years. The full release and related video are available on the NIMH site: Brain Matures a Few Years Late in ADHD, but Follows Normal Pattern.
Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD):
How to Help Children with Autism Learn
From Dr. Lauer and Dr. Beaulieu's talk
Quick facts about Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD)/ Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD)
- Autism is a 'spectrum disorder' meaning that it affects children in different ways and at different times in their development.
- Typically, delays and learning problems can emerge in several areas of functioning including social functioning, communication skills, motor skills, and overall intellectual potential.
- Each child has their own learning style that includes specific learning challenges as well as areas of preserved skills and, at times, exceptional abilities.
- Both autism and Asperger's disorder are on the same continuum but are distinct in their expression.
What are the challenges students with PDD/ASD frequently experience?
- Academic difficulties that can often be misinterpreted as learning disabilities.
- Problems with executive functioning skills.
- Difficulty in forming relationships with peers.
- Emotional difficulties due to learning and social problems such as anxiety, depression, low self-esteem.
- Fear of new situations and trouble adjusting to changes.
- May look like or be misconstrued as attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Nonverbal Learning Disability (NLD), Oppositional-Defiant Disorder or Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).
Why choose US to help YOU?
- Our evaluations are conducted by neuropsychologists who have been extensively trained in the early detection of autistic spectrum disorders and in the identification of specific patterns of learning strengths and weaknesses that are often associated with this condition.
- Our evaluations help determine which teaching style is best suited to fit an individuals' specific learning profile; we also offer suggestions regarding compensatory educational approached.
- We work as a team with other learning professionals, advocates and health professionals to enhance the child's potential for success in all settings.
'The design of truly individual treatment plans that exploit strengths and compensate for weaknesses begins with a detailed understanding of how learning is different for children with autism than for those without autism and how learning is different among children with autism.'
— Bryna Siegel, Ph.D., author of Helping Children with Autism Learn

Coming to see you for an evaluation was so helpful and Im so happy that I did this. After struggling for years with ADHD but not knowing thats what it was and almost completely ruining our marriage because of it, your diagnosis helped more than you could know. Now I know that its not just me the diagnosis has turned our lives around and helped me feel more accomplished at work. Thanks again for everything.

Bali Climate conference has a message for rural community
The world leaders recognised that 20% of the global emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) can be contained by forestation. The programme, Reducing Emissions From Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) aims to compensate the developing countries in the tropical region to maintain their forests and discourages deforestation. It allows developing countries to sell carbon offsets to rich countries in return for not burning their tropical forests from 2013.
REDD initiative is the need of the hour when largescale deforestation is taking place across the world for urbanisation, oil palm, soyabean and bio-fuel crop plantation.
The Bali conference also stressed upon the urgent need to cut carbon and methane emissions from tropical forests.
The Bali conference also adopted a resolution on adaptation fund to help poor nations to cope with damage from climate change impact like droughts, extreme weather conditions or rising seas. The Adaptation Fund now comprises only about $36 million but might rise to $1-$5 billion a year by 2030, if investments in green technology in developing nations surges. The fund distinguished the responsibilities of the Global Environment Facility and the World Bank. The fund would have a 16-member board largely from developing countries and would start operating from 2008.
Senior researchers of the United Nations Development Fund (UNDP) had urged the developed countries to urgently discuss adaptation funds as the key to solution of the problems. The Lead author of the recent UNDP report, Kevin Watkins said that as per estimate $86 billion annually. "The figure looks large, but actually it is only 0.2% of the rich countries GDP," he said and added that adaptation fund sourced from multilateral funding in the last two years was only $26 million—the amount spent by UK alone on flood control for a week.
A group of small island communities led by Biotani Indonesia Foundation has urged that the adaptation fund should include a special corpus to cover their initiatives.
The Bali conference succeeded in adopting a resolution on technology tranfer and also Its monitoring. It, however, failed address the vital issue of cut in GHG emissions and deferred it till 2009.
It also postponed until next year any consideration of a plan to fund an untested technology which captures and buries the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, emitted from power plants that burn fossil fuels.
It also failed to agree whether or not to allow companies to sell carbon offsets from destroying new production of powerful greenhouse gases called hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Benefiting factories have been the biggest winners under a UN scheme to reward companies which cut greenhouse gas emissions.

Grothe, Mark Blumberg describes how he became interested in "freaks of nature" as a way to question prevailing concepts within biology regarding genes, instincts, and pre-formed abilities. He talks about why he sees genetic determinism as "action at a distance thinking," and why he thinks it is similar to creationist views, and describes both as "magical ways of thinking about nature." He explains epigenetics. He describes how certain non-genetic factors that shape behavior may be inherited from one generation to the next. He discusses "sexual freaks" and sexual ambiguity in nature, and shows how in many ways, it is the norm in nature. He predicts the extinction of creationist thinking, and talks about how freaks of nature are a missed opportunity for those science advocates battling intelligent design and creationism, even as he also criticizes belief in "evolution's design" and "magical genes." He contrasts his views with those of evolutionary psychology as regards brain development. And he responds to notable critics of his views, such as Jerry Coyne.

From Uncyclopedia, the content-free encyclopedia
Heliocentrism is a theory which has become an established dogma in 21st century privately-funded science, despite having been abandoned in the 20th century, according to Conservapedia. Heliocentrism is the concept that a giant magnet is located in the center of the Earth, and the planets and the universe revolve around it, attracted by the magnetic energy. Heliocentrism is criticized for ignoring the everyday observations of mountain climbers and airplane travellers.
It has been characterized by Sarah Palin as "a lie perpetrated by scientists to diminish the glory of America" and pushed onto the good, God-fearing people by ignorant pagan-types suffering from Gross Moral Turpitude.
edit Proponents of Heliocentrism
The most ardent supporters of heliocentrism are found in US academia, despite or perhaps because of how the theory is being used to diminish the central role of the USA and its establishment at the center of the universe. Among those scientists that support it, the overwhelming majority also support the theories of evolution, climate change, nuclear fusion, ley line energy production, spacial time distortion, and extra-dimensional astral travel as well as using more tax dollars to fund their own research. Notable believers in heliocentrism include Charles Darwin, Lenin, Al Gore and Ellen DeGeneres.
edit Evidence of Heliocentrism
Heliocentrism is widely considered as being in accordance with the teaching of the holy book, which is commonly accepted as scientific evidence. Firm proofs of heliocentrism include:
- He has fixed the earth firm, immovable. (1 Chronicles 16:30)
- Thou didst fix the earth on its foundation so that it never can be shaken. (Psalm 104:5)
- who made the earth and fashioned it, and himself fixed it fast… (Isaiah 45:18)
- The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose. (Ecclesiastes 1:5)
As a reliable scientific theory, heliocentrism has surprisingly been approved by school boards in Kansas.

You have to like the attitude of Thomas Henning (Max-Planck-Institut für Astronomie). The scientist is a member of a team of astronomers whose recent work on planet formation around TW Hydrae was announced this afternoon. Their work used data from ESA’s Herschel space observatory, which has the sensitivity at the needed wavelengths for scanning TW Hydrae’s protoplanetary disk, along with the capability of taking spectra for the telltale molecules they were looking for. But getting observing time on a mission like Herschel is not easy and funding committees expect results, a fact that didn’t daunt the researcher. Says Henning, “If there’s no chance your project can fail, you’re probably not doing very interesting science. TW Hydrae is a good example of how a calculated scientific gamble can pay off.”
I would guess the relevant powers that be are happy with this team’s gamble. The situation is this: TW Hydrae is a young star of about 0.6 Solar masses some 176 light years away. The proximity is significant: This is the closest protoplanetary disk to Earth with strong gas emission lines, some two and a half times closer than the next possible subjects, and thus intensely studied for the insights it offers into planet formation. Out of the dense gas and dust here we can assume that tiny grains of ice and dust are aggregating into larger objects and one day planets.

The challenge of TW Hydrae, though, has been that the total mass of the molecular hydrogen gas in its disk has remained unclear, leaving us without a good idea of the particulars of how this infant system might produce planets. Molecular hydrogen does not emit detectable radiation, while basing a mass estimate on carbon monoxide is hampered by the opacity of the disk. For that matter, basing a mass estimate on the thermal emissions of dust grains forces astronomers to make guesses about the opacity of the dust, so that we’re left with uncertainty — mass values have been estimated anywhere between 0.5 and 63 Jupiter masses, and that’s a lot of play.
Error bars like these have left us guessing about the properties of this disk. The new work takes a different tack. While hydrogen molecules don’t emit measurable radiation, those hydrogen molecules that contain a deuterium atom, in which the atomic nucleus contains not just a proton but an additional neutron, emit significant amounts of radiation, with an intensity that depends upon the temperature of the gas. Because the ratio of deuterium to hydrogen is relatively constant near the Sun, a detection of hydrogen deuteride can be multiplied out to produce a solid estimate of the amount of molecular hydrogen in the disk.
The Herschel data allow the astronomers to set a lower limit for the disk mass at 52 Jupiter masses, the most useful part of this being that this estimate has an uncertainty ten times lower than the previous results. A disk this massive should be able to produce a planetary system larger than the Solar System, which scientists believe was produced by a much lighter disk. When Henning spoke about taking risks, he doubtless referred to the fact that this was only the second time hydrogen deuteride has been detected outside the Solar System. The pitch to the Herschel committee had to be persuasive to get them to sign off on so tricky a detection.
But 36 Herschel observations (with a total exposure time of almost seven hours) allowed the team to find the hydrogen deuteride they were looking for in the far-infrared. Water vapor in the atmosphere absorbs this kind of radiation, which is why a space-based detection is the only reasonable choice, although the team evidently considered the flying observatory SOFIA, a platform on which they were unlikely to get approval given the problematic nature of the observation. Now we have much better insight into a budding planetary system that is taking the same route our own system did over four billion years ago. What further gains this will help us achieve in testing current models of planet formation will be played out in coming years.
The paper is Bergin et al., “An Old Disk That Can Still Form a Planetary System,” Nature 493 ((31 January 2013), pp. 644–646 (preprint). Be aware as well of Hogerheijde et al., “Detection of the Water Reservoir in a Forming Planetary System,” Science 6054 (2011), p. 338. The latter, many of whose co-authors also worked on the Bergin paper, used Herschel data to detect cold water vapor in the TW Hydrae disk, with this result:
Our Herschel detection of cold water vapor in the outer disk of TW Hya demonstrates the presence of a considerable reservoir of water ice in this protoplanetary disk, sufﬁcient to form several thousand Earth oceans worth of icy bodies. Our observations only directly trace the tip of the iceberg of 0.005 Earth oceans in the form of water vapor.
Clearly, TW Hydrae has much to teach us.
Addendum: This JPL news release notes that although a young star, TW Hydrae had been thought to be past the stage of making giant planets:
“We didn’t expect to see so much gas around this star,” said Edwin Bergin of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Bergin led the new study appearing in the journal Nature. “Typically stars of this age have cleared out their surrounding material, but this star still has enough mass to make the equivalent of 50 Jupiters,” Bergin said.

Breakthroughs bring the next two major leaps in computing power into sight
Breakthroughs might make quantum computing, replacement for silicon practical within a decade
One of the best things about covering technology is that you're always on the edge of a completely new generation of stuff that will make everything completely different than it ever was before, even before the last generation made everything different.
"Completely different" always seems pretty much the same, with a few more complications, higher costs and a couple of cool new capabilities, of course.
Unless you look back a decade or two and see that everything is completely different from the way it was then…
Must be some conceptual myopia that keeps us in happy suspense over the future, nostalgic wonder at the past and bored annoyance with the present.
The next future to get excited about is going to be really cool, though.
You know how long scientists have been working on quantum computers that will be incomparably more powerful than the ones we have now because don't have to be built on a "bit" that's either a 1 or a zero? They would use a piece of quantum data called a qubit (or qbit, consistent with everything in the quantum world, the spelling wants to be two things at once), that can exist in several states at the same time. That would turn the most basic function in computing from a toggle switch to a dial with many settings.
Multiply the number of pieces of data in the lowest-level function of the computer and you increase its power logarithmically.
Making it happen has been a trick; they've been under development for 20 years and probably won't show up for another 10.
Teams of Austrian scientists may cut that time down a bit with a system they developed they say can create digital models of quantum-computing systems to make testing and development of both theory and manufacturing issues quicker and easier.
They did it the same way Lord of the Rings brought Gollum to life: putting a living example in front of cameras and taking detailed pictures they could use to recreate the image in any other digital environment.
Rather than an actor, the photo subject was a calcium atom, drastically cooled to slow its motion, then manipulated it using lasers, putting it through a set of paces predicted by quantum-mechanical theory, and recorded the results.
Abstracting those results lets the computer model predict the behavior of almost any other quantum particle or environment, making it possible to use the quantum version of a CAD/CAM system to develop and test new approaches to the systems that will actually become quantum computers, according to a paper published in the journal Science by researchers from the University of Innsbruck and the Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information (IQOQI).
Far sooner than quantum computers will blow our digitized minds, transistors made from grapheme rather than chunkier materials will allow designers to create processors far more dense – and therefore more potentially powerful – than anything theoretically possible using silicon and metallic alloys we rely on now.
Graphene is a one-atom-thick layer of carbon that offers almost no resistance to electricity flowing through it, but doesn't naturally contain electrons at two energy levels, as silicon does. Silicon transistors flip on or off by shifting electrons from one energy level to another.
Even silicon doesn't work that way naturally. It has to be "doped" with impurities to change its properties as a semiconductor.
For graphene to work the same way, researchers have to add inverters that that mimic the dual energy levels of silicon. So far they only work at 320 degrees below zero Fahrenheit (77 degrees Kelvin).
Researchers at Purdue's Birck Nanotechnology Center built a version that operates at room temperature, removing the main barrier to graphene as a practical option for computer systems design
The researchers, led by doctoral candidate Hong-Yan Chen presented their paper at the Device Research Conference in Santa Barbara. Calif. in June to publicize their results with the inverter.
Real application will have to wait for Chen or others to integrate the design into a working circuit based on graphene rather than silicon.
Systems built on graphene have the potential to boost the computing power of current processors by orders of magnitude while reducing their size and energy use, but only if they operate in offices not cooled to 77 degrees Kelvin.
It will still be a few years before graphene starts showing up in airline magazines, let alone in IT budgets. We'll probably be tired of them, too, by the time quantum computers show up, but there's just no satisfying some people.

The Chinook Arch
November 14, 2001
The above photo was taken at evening twilight in Calgary, Alberta by Jeff McIntosh. On the lee (eastern) side of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and the province of Alberta in Canada, chinook winds occasionally bring respite from cold weather. Chinook is an Indian name meaning "snow eater." These warm, westerly winds result from downslope winds - air moving across the Rocky Mountains and down onto the prairies. During those cold, dull gray winter days, Albertans sometimes look toward the mountains for the Chinook Arch, a curved patch of blue sky (as shown above) that indicates that warm winds are approaching. Over this past weekend, a strong chinook was felt in Alberta and Montana. Chinooks typically occur from early November to late March.

Written into History
Pulitzer Prize Reporting of the Twentieth Century from The New York Times
By Anthony Lewis (Editor)
(Times Books, Hardcover, 9780805068498, 352pp.)
Publication Date: October 2001
Other Editions of This Title: Hardcover
With each news day, history unfolds as steadfast journalists uncover facts and public opinion. Drawn from the New York Times's archive of an unparalleled seventy-nine Pulitzer Prizes, Written Into History offers a fascinating record of the twentieth century.
The Times's award-winning reports range from Antarctic dispatches on the Byrd expedition to the eyewitness account of the atomic bomb, from the First Amendment battle to publish the Pentagon Papers to the personal narrative of an interracial friendship. Pulitzer Prize winner Anthony Lewis culled through the newspaper's most acclaimed writing to chronicle life and history as it was happening, with such highlights as Otto Tolischus on Hitler, David Halberstam on Vietnam, J. Anthony Lukas on hippies, and Anna Quindlen on AIDS.
Lewis tells the stories behind the stories, describing journalism's changing role in the world. For armchair historians and aspiring reporters, this is a rich and memorable portrait of a century by the men and women who most artfully observed it.
Two-time Pulitzer-Prize-winning journalist Anthony Lewis is the author of Make No Law and the bestseller Gideon's Trumpet. Among the highlights of his nearly five decades of writing and reporting for the New York Times, he served as the Times's London bureau chief for eight years and contributes the twice-weekly "Abroad at Home" column to the paper's op-ed page.
"The kind of even-shaping journalism pioneered by Pulitzer is on display in Written into History, a collection of Pulitzer Prize reporting from the New York Times. Editor Anthony Lewis chronicles changes in the attitude of the press toward the presidency and government, as reflected in the kind of reporting that won the prize over the years and the trend toward recognizing more analytical writing. He also provides background on the history of the Pulitzer Prize and the arduous decision-making process. The selected award-winning articles (the Times has won more Pulitzers than any other American newspaper) are sorted into the following categories: investigative reporting; dangerous stories that put reporters at risk; international news; public advocacy; criticism of the arts; science reporting; and biographical and human-interest stories. Among the topics are Russian slave-labor camps during the 1950s, the Pentagon Papers, the Vietnam War, and exploitation of illegal aliens in the U.S."—Vanessa Bush, Booklist
"Lewis (Gideon's Trumpet) a writer with the New York Times for nearly five decades and himself a two-time Pulitzer winner succeeds in presenting some of the world's best recent journalism . . . There are plenty of both prominent and almost-forgotten stories: 'Red' Smith on the near-bankruptcy of New York City in the 1970s, Max Frankel on Nixon's 1972 visit to China, Linda Greenhouse on failed Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork. Lewis's fine introductory essay describes the post-Vietnam transformation of American journalism. The war and Watergate, he contends, made the press more skeptical of those in power and more confrontational in tone. Pulitzer Prizes increasingly went to fearless reporters like David Halberstam, whose tragically prescient analysis, in 1963, of the worsening situation in Vietnam constitutes one of the highlights of this book . . . Another highlight is Lewis's own analysis of the Warren court, which moved aggressively to 'federalize' legal protections in the areas of civil rights and criminal due process. It's a paragon of accessible legal writing. Perhaps the best, and certainly the most important, piece in the collection is Mirta Ojito's unforgettable recent story of two Cuban immigrants, one black and one white and how race comes to define and divide the two friends once they move to Miami. The piece is everything great journalism should be: empathetic, unmistakably relevant and a challenge to our basic ideals. For anyone interested in recent history or journalism at its best, this book will prove worthwhile."—Publishers Weekly

How do I determine whether a print material is dishwasher, food, and microwave safe?
I would like to print lunch boxes, which I can put into the microwave.
How could I determine, if the print material is appropriate (dishwasher, food, microwave safe)?

You should ask a more specific question, like "Is material X when printed using Y process Z safe"? Attempting to stuff information about all possible materials, processes and types of safety in to one question doesn't seem wise.

I am not familiar with the print materials, so I would like to ask it before I buy one. Btw this is the top voted question in the definition phase. So it is considered a good question by the community.

This is at least three separate questions.

well it won't be food safe because most thermoplastics are porous making it great for harboring bacteria. I'm not sure about the others.

This is a very nice question, with a well define scope and parameters that can be addressed objectively. Expecting "is material X when printed using Y process Z safe?" as a question is an arbitrary expectation: one could object that formulation too is too broad, as it did not ask "...with a nozzle in W material and at temperature T, post-processed with technique Q", for example.  This is a small site, with a tiny community around it.  We should work to make it relevant and helpful.  Comprehensively answering a question like "how to print functional microwave containers" would certainly help...

Although old it seems a legit and relevant question as of today. I vote to reopen. It also got above average (sadly) upvotes on this site.

This is an ancient pre-historic question (from before when the site was formed). None of the issues raised in the comments have been addressed - so it is still too broad and needs a narrower scope. A comprehensive answer would need to be many pages long (i.e. almost a thesis), needing to cover differences for X, Y, Z, W and T (as outlined in mac's comment). The OP has had 7 years to make the edits. Admittedly this could be a good and useful question. Maybe someone (else) should ask a newly formulated question (or series of questions) that addresses all of the issues in the comments.

If someone already has a comprehensive answer that they'd like to post, or an argument for opening (along with a possible proposal for a narrower edit), then maybe this should be raised in meta, as the comments isn't a good place for discussion.

@Greenonline I wanted to find printing materials that are dishwasher, food, microwave safe. Not sure how this question should be narrowed further, and then avoid being closed for "XY problem". Should I create a question for each material I find?

TBH, I really don't know. Maybe, as that is certainly narrower (maybe try and see if it gets closed?).  However, I think asking a question on Meta first, and asking what you've just asked in the comment, is probably a good idea, then you will (hopefully) get a discussion (and feedback) involving the community that could expand upon the reasons mentioned in the comments above -  and hopefully a consensus arrived at. Discussing in comments is not a good place to discuss.
